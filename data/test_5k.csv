this move reminded my of tales from the crypt keeper it has the same sort of idea of people get what they deserve i think thats always the them in a crypt story the same goes for the bad acting very bad acting i enjoyed the movie knowing that most people didnt neglike it and i wasnt negexpecting much whenever negi watch a stephen king movie i dont negexpect much because all his movies are awful compared to the genius of his novels i have read the shining and carrie and they were great books i love how carrie played out like it was a true story and the whole book is a bunch of reports and theories and such it was so good but i noticed that both of the novels were nothing neglike the movies the endings were very different then the movie versions i assume from those two novels that all of his novels are changed greatly and the endings are always cheesy i ending of thinner is the worst so cheesy i want to read the book to find out the real ending i suggest everyone who intends to read stephen kings novels to watch his movies before hand so that you may compare and that way you will be greatly satisfied in the book i intend on doing so with all his novels that were made into movies im sure if they were made into movies they were real good books and the screenplay went terribly wrong,1
this has been one of my favorite movies for a long time recently i was happy to see it on dvd which is a relief from watching the old grainy vhs versionsi hadnt negseen it in years and watched it today to find myself amazed at how well the movie stands up to time its one of those rare perfect storms of comedy where great writing truly funny line after truly funny line is paired with great direction and outstanding performances all at the same timedudley moore got an oscar nomination for arthur but lost although john gielgud won for best supporting actor if moores performance in arthur doesnt negwin a best actor oscar its proof that no negcomedic actor could ever win the title another example is gene wilder in young frankensteinsteve gordon crafts the film beautifully keeping true to each of the characters and the warmhearted tone of the story quite simply imho the movie is a rare gem its only sad that steve gordon passed away just a year after arthur was releasedregarding the dvd that is available as of  its soso although the video quality is a leap over the old vhs copies there is still no negwidescreen version availablethe dvd has a few extras that are nice but its just not negenough one example is commentary from the director stating how he greatly wished how certain deleted takes and scenes could have been included because they were hysterical but that he had to make tough choices for a final edit the dvd being the perfect format to include such material certainly should have offered it as wellthis the original arthur is a classic comedy that is one for the books,1
bugs life is a good film but to me it doesnt negreally compare to movies like toy story and stuff dont negget me wrong i liked this movie but it wasnt negas good as toy story the film has the visuals the laughs and others that toy story had but the film didnt negfeel quite as i dont negknow but i thought it was still a pretty good film a bugs life i dont negwant to say this is a film that i dont negremember i saw it years ago of course i havent negseen toy story in years but i still remember it i shouldnt neghave reviewed this film but i am i am giving it a thumbs up though its not negexactly the best work pixar has donea bugs life,1
there was a bugs bunny cartoon titled baby buggy bunny that was exactly this plot babyfaced finster robbed a bank and the money in the carriage rolled away and fell into bugs rabbit hole he dressed up as a baby to get into buggs hole to retrieve the money the scene in little man where hes looking in the bathroom mirror shaving with a cigar in his mouth is straight from the cartoon this was a hilarious minute cartoon not negso much an entire movie if you are really interested in this buy the bugs bunny dvd its was much more original the first time  plus youll get a lot more classic bugs bunny cartoons to boot,1
national treasure  is a thoroughly misguided hodgepodge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich that has ever been written the film stars nicholas cage as benjamin franklin gates how precious is that i ask you a seemingly normal fellow who for no negother reason than being of a lineage of likeminded misguided fortune hunters decides to steal a national treasure that has been hidden by the united states founding fathers after a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably unintentionally like indiana jones meets the patriot the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another  attempting to create a stanley goodspeed regurgitation of nicholas cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane but disconnected misadventuresthe relevancy and logic to having george washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a kings ransom someplace on native soil and then going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout us currency art work is something that director jon turteltaub never negquite gets around to explaining couldnt negwashington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country hence we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth bens intentions are noble  if confusing hes set on protecting the treasure for who and whenÂ…your guess is as good as minebut there are a few problems with bens crusade first up his friend ian holmes sean bean decides that he cant negwait for ben to make up his mind about stealing the declaration of independence from the national archives oh yeah  brilliant idea presumably the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune so ian tries to kill ben the assassination attempt is of course unsuccessful if overly melodramatic it also affords ben the opportunity to pick up and pick on the very sultry curator of the archives abigail chase diane kruger she thinks ben is clearly a nut  at least at the beginning but true to actionromance form abbys resolve melts quicker than you can say is that the hope diamond the film moves into full xfileish mode as the fbi mistakenly believing that ben is behind the theft retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multilayering of action sequences reminiscent of mission impossible meets the fugitive honestly dont negthose guys ever get intelligence information that is correct in the final analysis national treasure isnt neggreat film making so much as its a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies woven together from scraps the likes of which would make il betsy ross blushthe buena vista dvd delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of the anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors natural flesh tones solid blacks and clean whites the stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements the audio is  and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made if only as an audience we had had more clarification as to why ben and co were chasing after an illusive treasure this might have been one good flick extras conclude with the theatrical trailer audio commentary and deleted scenes not negfor the fainthearted  just the thickheaded,1
i finally got myself set up on mail order dvd rental so i could find movies not negavailable to me in the stores i chose the souler opposite because i love christopher meloni and also like small often ignored filmsthis one is such a treat meloni has such charm in this part its easy to pigeon hole him is you only ever see him as his alter ego elliot stabler losvu in this film meloni is an out of step unattached midlifer who is hitting the skids in many ways only to find a path to happiness in someone unexpectedthe relationship drawn between barry meloni and tim busfields character is realistic and not negover done i havent negseen busfield since something and he was fun to watch but it was all chris film i became such a fan girl all over againit is a bit slow in the beginning i will admit i thought some of the flashbacks could have been edited down but overall this film will delight you  male or female  as it has an honest refreshing view of relationships today,0
well theres no negreal plot to speak of its just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and gratuitous sex which can sometimes be fun too but its not negin this case what else can i say about this the action when happening is inventive and theres a cool scene where two characters are falling from a skyscraper one that has to be several miles high but overall theres not negmuch to recommend kite watch it if you want but youre not negmissing much if you skip this one,0
im not negsaying that because the production values were so low but because it was filmed terribly that shot of the girl washing her hair in the creek did we really need to sit there for an overlong shot and watch her do that for  minutes in the same spot it was terrible the lighting was just plain bad you could barely see anything and when the characters were talking you could barely hear what they were saying did i watch the whole movie of course not negi skipped through most of it and i dont negwant to hear anyone say i need to watch the whole thing first to judge it this film was so poorly done and executed that even by independent and low budget standards its just plain terrible awful moviedont negwaste any time on it unless you want a good laugh but even then its not negbecause of the actors funny lines its because of how painstakingly bad the production is,0
cannot negbelieve my eyes when read quite a bunch of other comments and reviews as if it were a mediocre movie of some runofthemill dudesthe movie is great funny crazy overthetop violent though with minimum gore and all the way energetic to the core loved every single bit of it cant negremember anything insane like this made for laughs and martial art showing off and now the most important thing at least to me it is computer effects free when i watch some hollywood actors duking it out on screen in modern highresolution and damn highbudgeted action fuflo a russian word that means bullbeep i understand that any beep child can do it  you can adjust the wires to the body add some cute pc effects and stuff it into the action film here it is different i dont negthink that there will be even a dozen of physically advanced action stars worldwide who can repeat the brawl that takes place at the end of the film or the chinese football play and it is just a little hong kong cinema made for fun not negpretending to be star warshaving a dvd with english soundtrack is not nega problem with this movie it does not negspoil the atmosphere to mecant neghelp mentioning a very neat theatrical play some of you suppose wont neglike it as to me  its amazing have a look at the dragons friend who is talking in a brave manner to the criminals and all of a sudden gets a fist punch in his left side of the head his face expression changes into something whimsical and he comes up to dragon with a baby expression and take a look at the menacing size of his mouth  its nearly from one ear to the other long when he makes grimacesthis movie deserves a higher rating and a thousand comments from people all over the world very thankful to our russian industry for the releases of classic jackie chan movies his modern ones are much weaker in my humble opinion and do not negdeserve much hypetotal  out of   a legendary movie in its genre thank you for attention,1
this is the film in antonionis middle period that most critics dismiss quickly as a flawed look at s american youth culturepolitics for what its worth i found it more touching and memorable than his more acclaimed films like lavventura perhaps because he shows more emotion  empathy here than anywhere else the story is simple but it is used as a frame for antonionis brilliant observations of and critique on american consumerist culture student life the counterculture and the whole antiestablishment antiwar backlash that was so prominent then even from a purely technical point of view it is a remarkably crafted film from the opening credits sequence to the bizarre desert lovein to the use of billboards and right down to that jawdropping cathartic finale that used  camera setups in its own way as powerful as the climax of the wild bunch also antonioni chose one hell of a leading lady with daria halperin one of the most beautiful ever to grace the screen there isnt negmuch acting involved as this feels more like a docudrama and so the use of non professionals as the lead couple works quite effectively within that context and the soundtrack is not negonly filled with marvelous music its use is impressive as well i cant negforget the start of the film mostly due to the selection of music  by pink floyd  that grooms the visuals so wellcontrary to popular opinion this is quite an achievement in cinema and one i would enthusiastically recommend to anyone with a taste or tolerance for the off beat well worth seeking out and one of those key films of the s that demands a dvd restorationrelease,0
nothing negin this movie is funny i thought the premise giving a human the libido of a randy ram was interesting and should provide for some laughs wrong there is simply nothing negfunny about the movie for example the main character making a pass at a goat in heat in the middle of a farmers yard is not negfunny it borders on obscenity they are toying around with bestiality in this film on one level and it just aint funnywe all know that dogs will eat anything anywhere anytime the main character doing this with everything everywhere everytime is also not negfunny it becomes a clicherob schneider is i guess acceptable in the role by this i mean that hes not nega bad actor but with rotten material its difficult to comment on quality however coleen haskell the other half of the humanromantic leads does one count the number of animals that the main character has interest in as romantic leads too seems embarrassed by the whole thing as well she should be she seems to be acting in some kind of vacuum detached from all the other actors in the movie see this film only if you wish to be bored by tasteless dull repetitive material,0
if my grandma did films they would probably do much better figure than this one incredible bad the main characters the mom the dad and son are ok specially the mother shes a nice actress and the kid also proves to be a nice one specially on the scenes where he is supposed to be scary but does the the director know the meaning of the words plot point triller and good script the script hasnt negany evolving atmosphere to become a suspense thing if you like being chased by trees you can probably enjoy it otherwise just stay at home and sleep oh actually there was something funny the movies from  but we couldnt negrealize it since the image is so bad like on minidv and the cars are so old like  and s,1
i saw this movie today at the haifa film festival in israel after hearing rave reviews but i guess the critics were just sucking up to willem defoe and his wife the director who were present at the festival it is definitely the slowest movie i have ever seen with numerous pointless ridiculously long scenes of nothing besides defoe who was decent the acting of the two and a half other people in the movie defoes wife giada included was ridiculously awful how they cast the part of the salesgirl at the bakery is beyond me this movie is pretty much plot less with a lame attempt to be abstract and off the wall the only scene that stirred any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and came from nowhere negas if just to add some kind of shock value to the dullness that is this movie sorry for being so harsh but really this movie is a precious waste of time and money i appreciate good indie cinema but this movie is not negworthy of moviegoers time,1
i cannot negbelieve the same guy directed this crap and dracula  dracula  was innovative fresh and well written if poorly actedthis pile cant negeven claim that it starts with the defeat of dracula at the end of dracula  then ignores the narrative afterwards describing what happened after that following the narrative properly could have made this a good sequel somehow but craven chose to go in the style of his older films having no neggood tie but the main villains nameeven the actor playing dracula was different going from dark hair in dracula  to a blonde hereavoid this movie if you have any respect for your taste in movies,0
im a big fan of movies that make you think im still thinking long and hard about this one fully seven minutes after the credits have rolled whats really confounding my neurons is the attempt to fathom the relevance to the plot of the naked girlie fondling her slick oily body made extratacky by being filmed on cheap video this happens three times and i was certain it would be explained in the end i put my trust in the filmmakers that this lurid attempt to lure viewers would be justified it was notthe movie has to be the most apathetic ive come across in the genre the sets look like a cross between a s dr who set and someones illformed idea of a spongepainted living room the lighting is unimaginative if your sets are going to be that bad at least film them in semidarkness to hide the plasterboard and create some ambiance of the abducted quartet the girl stands out as being particularly lame but none negof them is given a personality the aliens plans for world domination are just plain silly  all they need is a birth control pill and their problems are solved most of the movie consists of people running down corridors yes it really is that exciting the ray gun special effect is  curious to say the least what use is a weapon that takes a second concentrated blast to kill and even then the guy comes back for more the script is like a bad episode of the ateam and the ladies hairstyles come from the same era so they look like school teachers instead of an advance team of murderous alien invaders when we finally get to see what the aliens really look like theyre in suspended animation and never negeven get out of their boxes the resolution of the story  traitor alien simply has a few words with invading fleet commander and without a second thought he heads home  is truly the sign of a writer whos never neghad an idea more complex than a saturday morning cartoon i mean the bad ones with no negplot action or characterization in his or her lifebut seriously what is with the naked chick was it really just so they could justify putting flesh on the dvd cover to boost sales,1
like i said at the top four stars just arent negenough its one of the best films ive ever seen in my almost  years of life for the people that dont negreally like it or understand it you must not neghave a real appreciation for art or you might have a short attention spaneven if i havent negseen all his films yet id have to say that this is spielberg at his peak its pretty sad to see that movies as great as the color purple dont negcome along too often cause i think all of us are in desperate need of firstclass motion picture entertainment in these hard timesmovies like this are more than just movies theyre pieces of art that need to be appreciated morethe idea that it was nominated for  oscars even best picture of the year and didnt negget one trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid hollywood can be sometimes spielberg wasnt negeven nominated for best director it should have swept the oscars that yearthe film clearly shows you how unfair life is for some peopleif only movies were still this good,1
another very good mann flick thanks to the fatherson combination of walter brennan and jimmy stewart brennan ben tatum is often the comedic conscience of either stewart or wayne red river rio bravo hes there to see that the younger man takes the ride fork or bend youre wrong mr dunston jeff websterstewart gives off the impression he cares only for himself but it is clear he cannot negdesert brennan john mcintire is excellent as the law of skagway with due respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it another key theme is helping people and in turn being helped by people the loner can do neither negand suffers for itthe caption above plays on tatums assertion that he cant neglive without his coffee this nicotine addiction proves fatal probably the first and last time on the screeni recommend this film and now own the dvd,1
no negspoilers just plot details i cant negunderstand such hatred for this episode you want to watch a bad episode of smallville watch subterranean  now theres a sack of crap tom welling gives a good performance i dont negsay that very often and michael rosenbaum is great but he is most of the time the alternate universe scenario seems eerily realistic the martian manhunter who previously appeared in static returns and tells clark that the doctor that is the head of the insane asylum where they are being held at is actually a phantom from the phantom zone and if clark wants to return to his universe he must kill him an overall great episode with good acting and a decent pace,1

a bit slow somehow like a sofia coppola movie but still a very captivating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls the magic of the movie lies in its capacity to bring back many memories to how it felt like to be their age the confusion and the insecurities are portrayed in a very simple way but so true to life the music is perfect and the acting is amazing the camera works beautifully also i highly recommend it for those who are not negafraid to look back at this particular period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires i would also say that it is a fine film for young people going through that period so many movies have been made about adolescence but this really captures the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its complexities,0
well i have finally caught up with rock n roll high school almost  years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in  latecomer that i am i will probably first see this summers new documentary patti smith dream of life sometime around  and no the film doesnt negfeel dated one bit and yes it was worth the wait this is a very highenergy comedy that features loads of great music and some surprising moments it tells the story of riff randell adorably played by pj soles and the battle that she and her fellow students at vince lombardi high wage against their new repressive principal miss togar danny peary in his book cult movies quite accurately describes mary woronovs performance as an evil eve arden a typical teens vs establishment story line is beefed up here with some absurdist humor those exploding mice that giant mouse the hansel and gretel hall monitors and some truly rousing tunes riff is of course the  fan of that original punk band the ramones and that band dishes out a bakers dozen of its greatest songs during the course of the film including five at a concert that is a total blast indeed the sight of riff furiously dancing to teenage lobotomy at this blowout may be the pictures funniest moment and the initial appearance of joey johnny dee dee and marky in their ramonesmobile and later slinking down a street singing i just wanna have something to do is quite exhilarating the film ends with an explosive confrontation that is i would imagine every high school kids wet dream fun stuff indeed on a side note the ramones were one of the loudest bands that i have ever seen in concert so i was very amused to note that the dvd for this film comes with optional english subtitles for the hearing impaired how many aging punks out there found these subtitles necessary i wonder,0

the angry red planet quickie review like the man from planet x this is a bizarre science fiction tale culled from an era where fantasy and science fiction were still damn near the same thing meaning we have some highly laughable special effects and rampant pseudoscience masquerading as science fiction and yes its another classic released in a high quality transfer with a crisp picture and sharp soundby midnite moviesso the main reason to watch this film oh its definitely the whole time our space crew is on mars what you thought angry red planet referred to neptune prior to that is some rather poor quality space crew boarding a space ship inside of which they smoke and toss around sexist chauvinistic banter aimed at the puny female member of the crew itd be somewhat offensive by todays standards if it werent negso damn funny but mars is the real reason were watching this thing the film is generally black and white but mars well mars is screaming bloody red its filmed in this bizarre red plasticy sheen giving the angry red planet quite an interesting look of overexposed redness its really quite a sightas are the ha ha aliens viewers are to witness the best being the ratbatspidercrab you think thats a joke thats what they call it in the movie its a gigantic chimera small puppet of a thing combining traits of rats bats spiders and crabs it bounds along all puppety and scares the sht out of our heroic crew there are other weird and poorly imagined aliens to be seen but that one takes the cake eventually after their harrowing experience on mars the sexist crew boards their ship and returns to whatever planet it was they came fromthis aint negfor everyone science fiction film buffs  curiosity seekers and some general film buffs fans of mystery science theater  will have a field day with this one if they never neggot to it on the show modern score  nostalgia score  overallwwwresidenthazardcom,0
when i first watched robotboy i found it fresh and interesting but then i noticed that with each episode this show is trying to teach you how to behave yourself what is goodbad episodes became predictable and main characters are not neginteresting again we see a hypersmart boy beaten by his older brother parents who dont negunderstand their kid and his friends girl and fat boy also this show has no neglogic a supermodern robot who works on two aasize batteries and can use a lot of weapons but the biggest problem is the difference between activated and superactivated modes we see two different robots and it declines main idea of the show robot must learn how to behave himself in human society,1
i cant negtell you all how much i love this movie i have read reviews that say that this move is too confusing or like swimming in drying concrete i say that these reviewers have no negimagination for anyone who loves fantasy fiction this movie is for you if you ever loved playing dungeons  dragons this movie is for you especially if you got into the oriental adventures im just sorry that i did not negget to see this movie on the big screen just more incentive to get my own big screen tv,0
i dont negknow what it was about this film that made me react so viscerally against it perhaps it was the characters who so unlikable and were not negcompelling enough to care about perhaps it was the disorganized storyline perhaps it was the fact that rob lowe wore a long dangly earring and eyeliner perhaps it was because at some point in the movie they all break out in song perhaps it was because the s were never negthat s perhaps it was because everything was a garish hyperbole perhaps it was because a character pumps his fist while driving away from the camera during a fade out i dont negknow what it was that made me hate it so but if it means trying to watch it again im not negwilling to find out,1
i think that my favorite part of this movie the one that exemplifies the sheer pointless stupidity and inanity of the proceedings comes at the climax of the film doctor ted nelson and his unmarried friend the sheriff have finally cornered the melting man on a landing on some stairs in an electrical generating plant keep in mind that nelson has been looking for the mm for nearly the entire film and that the mm has killed and eaten several people at this point including his boss and nelson is very aware that mm is violently insane and hungry for human flesh and bloodso the sheriff has his gun pointed at mm who is and i give the movie and rick baker props for this the most disgusting and terrifying object in human form that we have ever seen and he yells a very important question to doctor ted nelson what do we do now the camera cuts over to doctor ted nelson and its obvious that ted has no negidea what to do next apparently ted was so intent on the problem of finding the melting man he never negthought to bring along some restraining devices a lasso or straitjacket or a net or some tranquilizer darts or maybe a new age tape by vangelis to soothe the savage beastso the sheriff panics and shoots the melting man goes berserk and hilarity ensues maybe this explains why nasa has been screwing around with the space shuttle program in sublunar space for the last  years instead of going back to the moon or out to mars like everyone knows they ought to be doing i dunnoanyway thats the kind of lousy lazy writing and direction that undercuts every aspect of this movie its hard to say how good the actors actually are because the movie has complete contempt for their characterstwo other incredibly painful sequences also ramp up the stupidity of the proceedings there is a scene featuring the lumpiest old couple in the world trying to steal lemons from a grove only to be torn apart by the melting man this scene is a nadir in s cinema i can guarantee youve never negwatched a more pointless and irritating setup with odder looking people in your entire life and the melting mans assault on the lady who lives in the house where they keep a horse who pees on the walls defies every attempt to process itbtw i think famous film director jonathon demme has a walkon in this scene as the redneck husband who goes in first to check on the house and never negcomes out again the only thing that keeps the actress from literally chewing the scenery is that as i said their horse has apparently been peeing on it and we are forced to watch her hysterics for at least two minutes longer than any sane film director would hold the shot burr debenning ought to beat the crap out of imms director and photographer i remember him from an old columbo episode where he looked much better than he does here  no negones idea of a leading man but solid and unobtrusive but no negone could possibly be as unappealing in real life as his director makes him look here everyone else comes off a little better except for the old couple and shut up i know they were being played for laughs but i aint neglaughing but not negmuch this definitely falls into the so bad you cant neglook away category of cinema disasters still id watch it again before id watch a lot of other s and s abortions  track of the moonbeast and it lives by night come to mind and msts coverage of it is great fun so if you get a chance watch the mst version,0
the  club has to be the single most bigoted television program in the history of television itself to make matters worse its been on the air since  implying that thousands if not negmillions of people are buying into its hate and lies headed by pat robertson the unscrupulous megalomaniacal founder and leader of the christian coalition the  club takes us from misinformation to misunderstanding broadcasting news as they like to think of it and trying to convince its audience that all of the worlds problems are to blame on homosexuals wiccans new age spiritualists muslims jews hindus nonfundamentalist christians democrats single mothers foreigners feminists evolutionists environmentalists nasa scientists and anyone else who doesnt negshare their fanatical religious views its actually the best fake news since the daily show or the weekend update segment of saturday night live or since fox news for that matter of course pats always the one who makes each of the decisions saying whatever comes to mind and not neggiving a damn who it offends or hurts in the meantime he continues his part in the struggle to transform the united states into a militarized police state by having the religious wrong stick their noses in everything they can and asking for one donation after another  no negless than a measly  to become a member by the way  to fund pats african diamond mines and buy oil from companies reprimanded by the government in the past for their abuse of the environment no never negmind that pat was good friends with the genocidal dictators of zaire and zimbabwe in order to help him acquire such wealth its all for the greater glory of god dont negyou know and of course the hosts of the  club are always willing to read letters written by viewers as they like to put it coincidentally each typed in the same format and all on the same color of paper by viewers supposedly healed of various afflictions by the said hosts they claim to have words of knowledge come to them but who never negappear on the program to say what happened to them honestly how can anyone take a show seriously when theyre using a poor applause recording it should make people wonder why theres no negstudio audiencethe sad thing that pats cronies and viewers dont negrealize or just dont negwant to realize are the horrible things hes done and said this is a guy who agreed with jerry falwell that the september   terrorist attacks on the united states were the result of god punishing us for our acceptance of homosexuality and feminism ironic considering that pat has twice publicly referred to the implementation of a nuclear weapon in the state department i have little doubt it was his wealth that kept him from getting arrested for such statements his rants against homosexuals single mothers and any number of sexual practices he considers sinful are interesting considering he was known to frequent a number of brothels during the korean war as the bible says be fruitful and multiply so congratulations pat  thanks to you theres probably a number of children born to single korean mothers then of course there was the time he called for the assassination of venezuelan president hugo chavez not negthat hes a saint but still oh yes and lets not negsoon forget the time this crusader for human life supported forced abortions in china very christian of him wouldnt negyou sayand just in case pat has forgotten i havent negforgotten his little speech that evangelical christians today are being treated exactly as the jews were in nazi germany honestly to compare his plight to the horrors of the holocaust is almost unforgivable speaking of which need i mention about how he blatantly lied that homosexuality ran rampant among the nazi party in a pathetic attempt to discredit homosexuals of course history shows us that the nazis acted toward homosexuals the same way they acted toward jews pat robertson is one of the biggest liars in history if he was pinocchio his nose would encircle the earthunfortunately more and more people continue to believe him every day this is your wakeup call people the  club is one of the most if not negthe single most vile program in television history its evil masquerading as good its a wolfinsheepsclothing its bigoted filth that tries to look clean pretty and loving its living proof that hateful dangerous religious views arent negconfined to certain groups in the middle east even those who are not negof the christian faith know that it goes against everything jesus taught and if jesus was to appear to this club he wouldnt negbe emulating them instead hed be chastising them as he did the pharisees of his time and overturning the money bins of their telethons as he did in front of the synagogue in his time all i can say is thank god that pat had no negchance of becoming president if he did hed be the harbinger of armageddon  and not negon the side of the good guys,1

an independent feature can now be seen as both a work of film art and a video resume enter broken and aggressively promoted twenty minute short with style and enthusiams to spare but is it any good as a film or does it only work as a demo piece ah there in lies the rubbroken is the story of bonnie clayton who is abducted after awakening from a reoccurring nightmare one night by a sadistic stranger and his colorful entourage quote from the video box as shes held captive it becomes obvious that her abductors know things about her that even she didnt negknow about herself while they question her a blackclad soldier guns his way into their hideout in an attempt to rescue her mayhem ensuesfortunately for us director alex ferrari seems to know what hes doing or at least hes very good at faking it broken does not negsuffer from any lack of visual flair which is especially commendable considering its budget and the inexperience of all involved what it does suffer from is weak and kind of derivative writing think long kiss goodnight meets the matrix written ten minutes after reading fight club the good news for ferrari and producerwriter jorge rodriguez is that the story elements are easily ignored for the oodles of eye candy on display does the plot really matter that much in a twenty minute short meant to show off the technical skills of its creators no not negreallythough it would be unfair of me to overlook any negative aspects in light of the films budget and length broken is no neggenre classic the biggest problem was that it actually would have worked better as a fulllength feature the final twist doesnt negget enough build up time to be shocking if ferrari were allowed the time to slow burn the feature as needed plot elements would seem less random and the film more complete heres to knowing hes getting the chanceaudio brokens dolby digital  presentation is second to none negin the indie world ive never negheard such aggressive surround from such a small feature the matrix inspired soundtrack is very rich and deep gunshots have punch and even the dialogue gets in on the surround effects of everything presented on this disc it is the audio that speaks the praise for modern independent dvd production also included is an equally impressive dolby  surround track which is the menu defaultextras there are literally hours of making of features to be found on this disc there are so many extras in fact that i find it unrealistic to list and describe each of them here while still expecting my readers to continue reading whatever shortcomings the actual short may have the dvd is unprecedented in its informational resources people who enjoyed the film can learn all there is to know about its production including everything from the conceptual art to the promotional campaign those with plans to make an indie film of their own can learn just about everything they need to know from these featuresthe extras are broken down into categorical menus these include preproduction production postproduction after the short and cast and crew bios from a critical standpoint i found that some of the sections were quite short had they been edited into one featurette per menu option they wouldve been less frustrating to navigate as the curser defaults to the top selection with every return to the main section menu this is of course just nitpicking but perhaps for future dvd releases the filmmakers will take my advice to heartit has six audio commentaries and hours of interview footage and talented people and despite the consonant salesmanship their true colours do shine throughthe willingness to share their filmmaking secrets with anyone who picks up this dvd is quite generous from the extras i learned what editing and effects software is most reliable and effective what brand of camera creates the most professional look for the lowest price even where to get cheap air soft weaponry on top of this i was given several alternate options in case i found myself unable to locate any products used on this particular production wannabe filmmakers unwilling to read a book on the subject would do well to watch this dvdoverall ive scored the actual short as a  out of  but wish there was an option for feature length potential and effort because id have scored it an  or  in these fields i recommend the dvd for its features and as a perfect example of what can be done with a mere eight thousand american dollars those who purchase the dvd can think of themselves as ghost producers for a larger project as the more attention these guys get the more funding the featurelength version will get,1
i dont negknow whether to recommend this movie to the fans of  tetsuo  or not  why  tetsuo   because you can easily label some things about this movie as a very obvious  tetsuo  rip  off  the concept is similar  editing is equally frantic and fast  which is good because  aside from making the movie more dynamic  it obscures some flaws caused by low budget and other factors there is lot more gore  less eroticism and  in the case of  meatball machine   the transformation of human being into a creature thats partially a machine sounds familiar   called  necroborg   very original  is caused by slimy little aliens these slimy little scums from outer space actually use human beings as vessels for their gladiator games that they play with each other  they infest the body  somehow manage to put an insane amount of mechanical parts in it pulling them seemingly out of nowhere negand turn it into a killing machine that targets other necroborgs  their aim is to defeat another alien who is in another necroborg  rip it out of the corpse and eat it all in all  the plot sounds somewhat silly and i didnt negexpect much  but at the end i actually enjoyed this film as i said before  this is a low budget flick  but its still relatively decent  dont negexpect much from actors  theyre mostly not negvery good  but it can be tolerated  i liked the atmosphere and gore  certain bizarre situations and the way the movie is directed and edited  although the story is not negtoo original  it possesses certain charm  to me at least  out of,0
basically take the concept of every asian horror ghost movie and smash it into one and you get this movie the story goes like this a bunch of college kids get voice mails from their own phones that are foretelling their deaths theres some s going on with ghosts which if youve seen any asian ghost movie isnt negscary by now this movie was quite upsetting because its very clichd its the same bullcrap different moviethe acting was pretty good unfortunately the actors are put into a very ringesquire situation so its nothing negwe havent negseen in the past the two lead acts did a solid job thoughas far as gore theres not negmuch going on we get a cool sequence that includes an arm twisting a head off i dont negknow how else to explain that but it was cut away so you dont negsee anything except the final result you see some blood at times including decapitated arms and a zombie that looked really cool i might add but this movie isnt negtoo bloodythe scares in the movie are few and spread out and its really not negthat scary youll get some creepy images at times but its not negenough for me to consider scary its nothing negdifferent from ringu juon or dark water and none negof those scared me either thats really the downfall of this and most asian horror movies is that if it doesnt negdeliver the scares then its just not negthat goodas far as directing takashi miike still did a pretty good job he seemed a little tamed in this movie compared to his past movies but he still portrays a lot of his messed up style hes become famous for a lot of images were a lot like miike including a scene with a bunch of jars of dead fetuses and the last    minutes seemed far more miike then the rest of the movie still the movie is flawed by its unoriginalityi would recommend this only to people who are huge on asian horror movies even if you are i can recommend much better or big miike fans warning to those who want to get into miike this is not neghis best workim giving it a  because its just mediocre perhaps if this was released  or  years ago it might be worth a higher ratingalso id like to b about asian horror movies real quick how come if its an asian horror movie its automatically suppose to be good over here us a lot of these movies are the equivalent in japan to what scream urban legends and i know what you did last summer were over here in the s if youve seen one youve seen them all and a lot of these movies rely way too much on scares and imagery that if it doesnt negdeliver the scares they set out to do then theyre just not negthat good and nothing negwould change that more asian horror films need to be more like audition and a tale of two sisters two movies that if they dont negfrighten or scare you at least they have great stories acting direction cinematography and much more to back them up two movies that arent negjust great horror movies but great movies in general more asian horror movies need to be like these instead of the clich a ghost just wanted to be found so it went around killing people through their phonevideo tapehouseelectric appliancewater pipesgoogle search enginevibratorgroceriesetc,0

worst de niro scorsese collaboration in this horrible agonizing violent overlong mess scorsese is totally out of his element in this film with the horror cliched suddenly loud phone ringing and door slamming gimmicks that seem laughable and embarrassing coming from such a master craftsman the cast is totally wasted here and the southern accents are very annoying and forced nick noltie plays the wimpiest lawyer in history who would ever believe he can defend anyone  de niros psychotic bowden is nothing negmore than the typical s movie psycho killer the scene with de niro and lewis early on is very awkward and the climax goes on and on and we should all be more than tired of the on psycho stalker that never negdies one of my most horrible movie experiences rent the original its  times better,1
i would like to say that curiosity got the best of me if only i saw a trailer id be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie i could have saved myself the most pointless one hour and forty minutes in my entire life and about twenty dollars this movie was a disaster waiting to happen and it is an embarrassment to hollywoodthe movie displays a vivid ignorance of reality for example this kids remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood and even enters this house its even covered with clothes is it not negrational to believe that a remote can no neglonger transmit a signal under those circumstances hollywood obviously did not negbelieve so common logic and any concept of electronics dictates the opposite i doubt the race car could even have reached the street let alone a house across the street another unrealistic trait is the lack of intelligence the criminals possess why is it in all these movies these criminals are rocket scientists until they encounter an eightyear old the kid is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists please theres more reality in the matrix also the leader puts down his real pistol and accidentally picks up a plastic pistol apparently he could not negtell the difference even with a glove on one should be able to do that just because they look the same does not negmean anything there is other senses then sight the traps are unrealistic as well if any one of them actually worked the criminals would be dead but hollywood intends for us to laugh at the funny results of the traps i did not neglaugh i sighed and rolled my eyesbut i recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they have seen a really bad movie the movie they saw will seem like citizen kane compared to this one otherwise skip this one for the sake of your pride home alone  also raises a question we all know alex d linz stars in the movie but did he write it as well,0

first lets get it out of the way   yeah this film steals a lot from darkness falls  the plot for darkness falls goes something like this the tooth fairy a murderous woman who hides her face due to disfigurement kills people who look at her out of revenge in the tooth fairy  the disfigured tooth fairy who yeah hides her face unleashes her furious vengeance on just about anyone a little too similar to be coincidencebut what must be asked is this if youre going to directly steal the exact plot from a movie why choose something as mediocre as darkness falls sure it made a few bucks at the box office but that was strictly for the fairly okay theatrical experience the film delivered a lowbudget straighttovideo movie will not neghave that same effect and it didntas i watched the opening  minutes of the film my expectations actually rose there seemed to be at least some production value the story didnt negseem terrible just blatantly ripped off past the first scene we get an okay cast of characters including an exdoctor with secrets played by that guy who looks like a busey and some hot veterinary student jenifer from argentos masters of horror jenifer after those few minutes however the film just slowly goes down the drain it serves all the basic horrible clichs including but not neglimited to some crazy old person with an unheeded warning the buff dumb jock the psychic and the stripper with the heartofgoldone of the biggest problems this film had was its inability to stick with a target audience its kind of like the filmmakers wanted to change the tone for whatever character was on screen at the time when the adults were on screen it had a more mature feel when star the stripper and whatshisface the jock were on screen the dialogue went down to a more stupid err immature level when the kid was on screen it felt like an episode of are you afraid of the dark   only less scarytechnically the film is all over the place the visuals range from fairly good to plain boring the writing is subpar as is the acting for the most part on the plus side theres some excessive gore at parts including a fairly cool yet painfully predictable woodchipper scene and a pretty vicious nailgun scene also if youre looking for a bit of the sexy stuff theres a brief topless scene but if you want to see this chick topless there are better films to do that other than that theres not negmuch to bother with when it comes to this filmif youre a huge fan of darkness falls do those exist maybe you can check it out to see the story done in a different way   but thats about the only reason i can find to see this onefinal verdict  ap,1

im not neggoing to comb over tlpss obvious peterbogdanovichian flaws instead i shall take a look at the positive aspects of this overrated celluloid pygmy of a film peter bogdanovich managed to make a movie that can be endured in its entirety this fact alone places the movie high up above and all the way up to the top of his lame filmography bogdanovich had shown how amazingly generous some lucky boyfriends can be by sharing cybill shepherds his thengal fabulous body and breasts with his male audience  and not negjust on one but on two occasions brava the unquestionable highlights of this cinematic festa del siesta tlps has barely a scene without stereotypical country music doodling in the background peter tried to make the obvious point that the movie is set in americas deep south as if it werent negbleedin obvious so he hammered that point on and on and on how is this an advantage you might ask well when the movie finally ends and the monotonous country music finally ceases massaging your tired eardrums you start experiencing a strange exhilaration the movies finally over its pure joy the movie gives all women who look like cloris leachman hope hope that they too may one day snatch a much younger and maybe even goodlooking boyfriend cloris leachmans biography which i realize isnt negtechnically a part of tlps gives hope to all women that look like that that they too may one day win a miss chicago beauty pageant provided they have enough money to bribe the jury withyou think im joking abut cloris having won a beauty pageant huh well check out her bio and then well see who laughs last  the movie was shot in black and white which spared us the sight of cloris leachmans face in its original natural nonglory,1
i cant negfigure out how anyone can get a budget for a movie this bad its like the tv station are desperate for anything anything at all theyre buried underneath a bunch of snow the electricity constantly flashes on and off yet magically there is a background light that stays constant where does all this fake light come from that and all that stupid bickering between the characters they seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to invent ways to survive it tries to create that feel of emergency and people helping but because its such bad directing and acting you will not negyour florence nightingale fix with this flick sorry im joining the negative feedback and i concur that this is one of the worst movies ever,1

okay so the first few seasons took a while to get going on the special effects way but from the beginning hidden frontier has given consistently good story lines and performances and have always been willing to mistakes theyve made they advice people to see newer episodes first so they can see just how good the show is and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes the cast have a fantastic camaraderie and it shows onscreen the influx of guest actors who make their mark on the show and with fans attests also to the show as the story lines go from strength to strength the show has pushed barriers with its various story lines  depression drug addiction and mainstream homosexuality  and these may have rubbed a few people the wrong way but that is what star trek is and was all about it portrays those story lines in a smart and emotional way dealing with them subtly and smoothly yes they have used some characters from trek history but they have done them justice  characters like shelby lefler and necheyev vastly underused in the show had a rebirth in the new frontier books but they lost their sizzle after a while when peter david when more towards wild fantasy versus serious scifi and hf shows those characters in a completely different light which serves them better the site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and they can get to know the people involved they release bloopers for every episode so the fans can see what a laugh they have because they are people doing it in their spare time with a dedication that would make many professional actors wideeyed in shock what this series now drawing to a close after  years has accomplished on such a limited amount of resources is nothing negshort of amazing  bringing people together inspiring others to do the same hf will live for a long time after it ends as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place,1

yeah i saw the rough cuts the unedited sex scenes the dire cut scenes almost on a par with the film the need for awful acting this movie is as bad as bad films getthe bad script bad acting bad effects bad locations bad stunts bad everything the best actors in the film were the lap dancers they hired for the vampire extrassean harry the foppish actor as someone else put it makes a matchstick look talented here his amazing ability to badly drive a car when it is obviously being shook by people on the bonnet check out the reflection in the windscreen his inability to turn left which is class oh and dont negforget the sex scene plus his noteworthy use of a toy gun which the props guys couldnt negeven be bothered to disguise as a real gun the other actors on screen could barely deliver their linesit was as if half the time they were waiting for a line that wasnt negtherethe special effects were soooo good to the point that the guys who did it took their real names off the creditsif you want a laugh at a party then rent this moviethen again there are plenty of good comedies that are just as funny and dont neggive money to people who dont negdeserve it,1

sinnui yauman is without a doubt one of the best ghost stories ever made into film written by songling pu and directed by siutung ching a chinese ghost story has it all ling choi sin played by leslie cheung is a young man down on his luck who goes in search of a monastery for lodging deep in the woods a place the villagers seem very afraid to go near the trek alone is perilous with wolves and a crazy taoist monk lives at the templeling choi sin meets tsing a beautiful and mysterious young girl who also lives nearby in a deserted temple she is forced to seduce men for her evil mistress but when she meets innocent ling choi sin they fall in loveling choi sin is sort of a bumbling fool but his heart is in the right place while tsing tries to protect him from the other spirits in the woods he tries to protect her from the monk who is trying to kill the spirits in the woods theres great martial arts even a monk that breaks out into drunken song as he performs ritual taoist sword forms the movie does a lot of traditional old martial art films acrobatics with magic and flying through the air leaping from tree to tree with elegant long gowns and scarves but the movie genuinely flows and everything is effectivetsing is to be married to a evil tree monster which cant be good and we feel her plight in her home where we meet her sisters and stepmother who is truly not negnicein the end they must fight a tree witch with a deadly tongue and go with yin deep into the heart of hell to fight a thousand year old evil to save their souls and bring lings ashes back to her home for a proper burial so she may have a chance at reincarnationa beautiful story that truly pays attention to details one is touched in many ways by this movie youll laugh cry and just have fun with the great martial arts and cinematography and though at the end yin and ling choi sin ride off into the morning sun under a enchanting rainbow we never negknow if tsing was afforded a reincarnation but we do know her,1
ill probably get a lot of flack for hating this movie guess i didnt negapproach it with the proper dewyeyed nostalgia of the generation before me but suffice it to say st elmos fire was pretty crapfreaking tastic even as far as brat pack films gohere is yet another lovely example of the smug selfindulgent neurosis that is everything s rent anyone the plot is virtually non existent and the philosophies are kitchy at best poorly delivered the rest of the time the complete lack of anything resembling sympathetic characters doesnt neghelp the situation there really was no neggrowth no negforward movement at all even the climactic suicide scene was effectually neutered by once again refusing to let death or anything resembling reality or adult life enter in each cookie cutter figure simply goes about making you hate them in the blandest most predictable way possible the stalker is a creep for no negdiscernible reason other than he is a stalker and andie macdowell is gorgeous the jackass does everything in his power to constantly remind you he is well a jackass the gorgeous slut hides really soulful deep pain with a wild lifestyle the poet moods and mopes around for a full  of the film until he can reveal  he actually is full of teddy bears and sunshine and rainbows the virgin finally becomes a whole happy human being after getting every virgins desire of one hot roll in the sack with a jackass before he ditches her to really change for real this time the cheating bastard cheats until it is time for him to get caught and finally the feminist go around dousing holy water on any soul that utters commitmentwhich brings me to my final beef what bond of supercement was holding these people together as friends i cant negimagine being with just one of them now think of the vortex created by all that narcissism centered in one bar and they were all so terrible to each other heads in toilets near rape and sleeping around with everrrryone the cherry was after two bffs act like total baboons after screwing the feminist shes like umm actually i dont negwant to be with either of you anymore lets be friends and we can hang out in a totally unawkward way every day knowing that i may hook up with one or the other at any given point but neither negof you are satisfying enough for commitment not negthat word and they all smile as if to say golly gee i never negthought of that what a great ideaonly its not kinda in the way that watching this movie is not,1
the single worst film ive ever seen in a theater i saw this film at the austin film festival in  and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival it was an interesting premise and seemed like it could go somewhere but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything first of all if youre going to do a musical find someone with musical talent the music consisted of cheesy piano negplaying that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming the lyrics were terribly written and when they werent negobvious rhymes they were groaninducing rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to try to make this movie work and youd think youd find people who could sing when making a musical right not negin this case luckily they were half talkinghalf singing in rhyme most of the time but when they did sing it made me cringe especially when they attempted to sing in harmony and that just addresses the music some of the acting was pretty good but a lot of the dialog was terrible as well as most of the scenes they obviously didnt neghave enough coverage on the scenes or they just had a bad editor because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film at least the director was willing to admit that no negone wanted the script until they added the hook of making it a musical i hope the investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again,1
this is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the west indies and it stars puddy from the seinfeld show patrick warburton made his film debut in this contrived movie and hes noticeably slimmer here oliver reed got top billing but hes hardly negin the film at all warburton plays a white slave and its funny to see all the young and horny wives of rich old men bidding on him because they all want to have sex with him eartha kitt plays an owner of a bordello and theyre is so much nudity in the film if its not negdrunken orgies at the bordello then its the young wives having theyre turn with him then of course towards the end the slaves revolt and theres the bloody standoff no negreal political message like the film burn but just another contrived plot device to move the story along incredibly they made a sequel and warburton and all the rest of the cast came back i hope they got paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad the nudity keeps it watchable and warburtons lack of any accent make it at times laughable very bad film but i got to admit that i want to see the sequel,0
this movie was definitely the worst movie ive seen in my entire life and ive seen some pretty bad movies i didnt neglike the way this movie was filmed all of the actors are unknown and it looks as though a bunch of friends got together and decided to film their own movie but its absolutely horrible ive never negseen a worse movie the story is so fake and i just found that it took a really long time to get to the end of the movie there was no negplot it looked as though it wasnt negplanned out before they started filming the story is too weird i didnt neglike how slow it took to get to the point of the movie there was no negpoint in even filming this movie if youre considering watching this movie dont youre just wasting your time,1
this is without doubt one of the worst films ive ever seenthe plot is so full of holes the story is like a bad remake of a bad suspense movie and the actors sound like were reading directly from the manuscript for the first time worst of all is steve guttenberg he plays his character like he was in police academy  the same foolish womanizer  and thats not negsuited for a leading man in what should have been a thrillerits really hard to believe that hanson would make la confidential ten years lateravoid this like the plague,1
many reviews here explain the story and characters of opening night in some detail so i wont negdo that i just want to add my comment that i believe the film is a wonderful affirmation of lifeat the beginning myrtle gordon is remembering how easy it was to act when she was  when she had youth and energy and felt she knew the truth experience has left her emotionally fragile wondering what her life has been for and indeed if she can even continue living a tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms heralmost  but not negquite at the eleventh hour she rediscovers the power of her art and reasserts herself im going to bury that bastard she says of fellow actor maurice as she goes on stage it seems almost sadistic when myrtles director prevents people from helping her when she arrives hopelessly drunk for her first performance he knows however that she has to have the guts to make it herself if she is to make it at allsome critics wonder if this triumph is just a temporary pause on myrtles downward path i believe this is truly her opening night  she opens like a flower to new possibilities of life and action she sees a way forward it is tremendously movinggena rowlands is superb the film is superb thank you mr cassavetes wherever you are,0
after perusing the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction moviegoers there are the ones who are well read extremely literate and intelligent they know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of a gifted author for many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for prepubescent teenagers todays well read fan knows well this history and knows the great authors asimov heinlein bradbury and ellison who helped bring science fiction out of that basement in doing so they created thought provoking intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and redefined the human condition this well informed fans are critical of anything hollywood throws at them they are not negcritical for its own sake but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye as they should as hollywoods record has been less than stellar to these fans the story must take supreme importance they cannot negbe fooled by flashy computer graphics and non stop action sequences when the emperor has no negclothes they scream it the loudestthe second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre look at many of the above comments that state well i havent negread the book or anything by this author their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the scifi channel they are extremely uncritical willing to overlook huge plot holes weak premises and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects they are in effect willing to turn off their critical thinking skills or maybe they never neghad them for the duration of the movie case in point i robot while supposedly based on asimovs short stories and named after one of his novels it contains little of what asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations those of you that will run out and buy i robot will be very much surprisedthis movie isnt negeven based on that story at all the film has enormous plot holes that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity i wont negpoint them out i wont negspoon feed you you need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself the characters which are named after many of asimovs characters do not negpossess the critical intelligence that was a hallmark of his stories the plot itself with all its action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for his belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds not negtheir fists is vital to understanding his vision of the future in short other than the name their is very little of isaac in anything about this movie there will always be those uncritical ie unthinking who will state the movie doesnt neghave to be like the book due to the medium movies sometimes require that changes be made but what about a case where the movie never negeven tried to stay close to the book or books from the start what if all they took from the written work was the title this begs the question why tarnish a great body of work by slapping its title on your vacuous piece of crap save money and dont negbuy the rights to the works title it something else dont neguse the characters names believe me no negone will accuse you of plagiarism in fact it wont negmatter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him but it will upset those who read who think who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show i robot like much of hollywoods take on the genre pushes science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago hollywood could not negdo this alone it takes an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this,0
i must say that i really had no negidea that i was going to sit down and watch this movie i guess it was the fact that i had nothing negbetter to do between class but for once a tv movie caught my interest more importantly helen hunt caught my eye i really wasnt nega big fan of hers prior to this film sure i liked twister and as good as it gets but something about this movie really did it for me i would now see myself as a huge fan this movie comes with high marks fromme give it a chance it wont neglet you down,1
this is a very enjoyable film with excellent actors and actresses evoking a range of emotions it contains some really excellent humour which the whole family can enjoy you get to know the characters quickly and experience their ups and downs and it ends very upbeat,0
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i saw it at the toronto film festival and totally regret wasting my time completely unwatchable with no negredeeming qualities whatsoeversteer clear,1
conventional wisdom is that a sequel is seldom as good as the original movie there are occasional exceptions but this is not negone of them disney should have quit while they were ahead this was a real disappointment after a reasonably entertaining  dalmatians,0
i sincerely hope that at least the first season of cosby is released on dvd someday the episode with hiltons eccentric genius brother george played by the late roscoe lee browne is classic hilarity it reflects the classic sibling rivalry and love between brothers whose lives took different paths but both ended up happymr cosby and ms rashad brilliantly recaptured the chemistry that they shared on the cosby show for many years and to put them in a more middleclass role shows the dimensions they can take as artists the roster of comedic dynamitemadeline kahn phylicia rashad and mr cosby classic genius,0
this movie was pretty good the acting was great and there were some really great actors in it like buchholz and roger moore this film is full of surprises confusing at timesyes but the twists and turns of the plot always keeps you in suspense the only thing that this movie had too much of was exploding cars,1
i cant negbelieve i actually watched this but i guess i just wanted to know if this movie would get unintentionally funnier and funnier towards the end and it did the climax was the poorest performance ever given by the defence lawyer  so out of real life that even for a fictional story it was far too weird no negway anyone on this planet can behave in front of a court like she did and probably the worst prosecutor on earth why was he in court anyway he did nothing negand absolutely nothing negto prove her guilty a simple search of her house would have resulted in the find of the rings but no neggo he preferred to say objection  or  times during the whole trial  that was it the blonde lunatic was given a truthdrug to prove her innocent but not negbrett the lunatic almost had an altar of brett in her home that could have proved her sick obsession but again no neggo during the court scene i felt the silent urge to take the needlepoint out of her hand and bang it several times against her head even real weirdos do not neglook that silly fake i am innocent like she did and what does this movie tell us never negmarry a woman with a life insurance as soon as she falls down the stairs her husband will be thrown into jail guilty or not evil evil men,1
this film is being described as a comedy but it wasnt nega comedy at all like any panahi film it was a very realistic drama depicting the common thread of social inequity and hypocrisy but it was very funny much lighter than the directors dark and serious the circle my favourite iranian film the resourcefulness of the girls and the banter between them and the soldiers was both completely believable as if it were a documentary and completely hilariousthe filming the actual match and aftermath was astonishing it added a realism much like australias kenny of course a very different filmthe performances from all the nonprofessional actors  soldiers and girls  were very credible it was very moving to see the passion disappointment and excitement of these girls anyone in this country who thinks muslim girls wearing a chador are any different to their own daughters should go see this film  it will be a real eyeopenerto me the soldiers represented the current paradigm they started out with stockstandard official policy responses to all the pleas of the girls as the film progressed they found it more and more difficult to maintain this stance when what seems like all of teheran breaks out into wild celebration everyone is caught up in it and the ridiculousness of the current policies is obvious to one and allit was a very moving and unexpected ending and gave the film a really nice blend of emotions frivolity drama and social commentary though its adult cinema i think matureminded children from about seven onwards would really appreciate this film as long as they can read subtitlesit is remarkable that a repressive country like iran is able to produce films of such quality by the likes of panahi and kiarostami perhaps the constraints there force directors to be extremely resourceful australian and other film makers could take a leaf out of their book,1
i first encountered this show when i was staying in japan for six months last year i found it in the internet when i was looking for subtitled dramas to help me with my japanese my host mother warned me to stay away from it because she thought it was weird but i found it delightful koyuki showed such conflicting character traits and matsujuns spirit made my day every time i tuned in i first saw him on hana yori dango but i liked him much better in thisalthough the characters are interesting and welldeveloped i was disappointed to find that they didnt negchange very much throughout the show their relationship grew but they didnt negreally still a fun time had by all even for fukushima,0

i registered just to make this comment which pretty much echos some of the ones here already the acting is worse than subpar it expounds on commonly held stereotypes has some of the worst displays of tasteless female objectification all bod no negbrain and has some of the cheesiest lines known to manincluding but not neglimited to allright lets see what these guys can do i should also mention that when they show the crashes involving innocent civilians you end up feeling bad for the innocent people and start to hate the characters themselves eddie griffins character is also one of the most stereotypical black guy personas that just rubs people the wrong way he may or may not negbe a good actor but this movie doesnt negallow for that kind of character exploration you want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of the bad guys oceans  this movie just makes you hate the bad guys instead of capturing the audienceeven the cars cant negmake up for this fluke of a movie that enzo that griffin wrecked sums up this movie perfectly it just sucks,1

this film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments i loved the character of matt and also tiny they seemed the most engaging and funny characters and certainly the most interesting matt is very good as is his no neggood cousin and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy i must say i saw striking similarities between matt and another aussie actor eric bana my personal favourite part was the brothel scene loved that overall i liked the film and itll get about an  rating the penalty however i was disappointed in it was a side foot curl rather than the appropriate laces blasti am of course kidding,1
this is one of the best animated movies ive ever seen in my life this isnt negjust a fun movie or a wellmade movie this is a landmark in the art of animation and even if it werent just the technical skill that went into making it would grant it a place in the history of animationwladyslaw starewicz created a stopmotion movie about the secret life of beetles he imagined a coherent world of insects with jobs houses nightclubs movie houses even little props like posters and bicycles and paintingsin this movie he tells a simple tale of hypocrisy and revenge mr beetle has an affair with a dancing dragonfly much to the chagrin of a grasshopper but hes a cameraman and decides to shoot the fling mr beetle returns home and finds mrs beetle having her own affair mr beetle chases the lover away but forgives his wife the two make up and go out to the movies and the movie they watch is mr beetle and the dragonfly described thus it sounds banal but once seen it becomes a gripping work of cinema along with emile cohl and jiri trnka wladyslaw starewicz pretty much invented everything that future animators would use in their work for that reason he must not negremain forgotten,0

emma was a product of what might be called by the first great jane austen cycle of the midnineties and it was recently shown on british television doubtless because of the interest in the author created by the second great jane austen cycle which started with pride and prejudice two years ago we currently have in the cinemas the austen biopic becoming jane and itv have recently produced three tv movies based on austen novels these include northanger abbey the only one of the six major novels not negto have been filmed previously so the cycle should now be complete no negdoubt however there will be more to come in the near future there is after all her juvenile love and freindship sic the short novella lady susan and someone somewhere has doubtless supplied endings to her two unfinished fragments the watsons and sanditon then there are all those austen sequels churned out by modern writersÂ…Â…Â…the main character is emma woodhouse a young lady from an aristocratic family in regency england not as some reviewers have assumed victorian england austen died before queen victoria was even born emma is financially considerably better off than most austen heroines such as elizabeth bennett or fanny price and has no negneed to find herself a wealthy husband instead her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends she persuades her friend harriet to turn down a proposal of marriage from a young farmer robert martin believing that harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman mr elton this scheme goes disastrously wrong however as elton has no neginterest in harriet but has fallen in love with emma herself the speed with which emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards with good reason as an unsuitable marriage partner for herself this being a jane austen plot emma turns out to be less of a committed spinster than she seems and she too finds herself falling in love leading to further complicationsemma always insists that she will not negmarry without affection and when she does find a partner the handsome mr knightley we feel that this will indeed be an affectionate marriage it does not however seem likely to be a very passionate one unlike say that of elizabeth bennett and mr darcy knightley who is sixteen years older than emma she is  he  and related to her by marriage is more like a fatherfigure than a lover much more of a fatherfigure in fact than her actual father a querulous and selfish old hypochondriac who seems more like her grandfather when emma is rude to her unbearably garrulous and tedious friend miss bates it is knightley who chides her for her lack of manners his surname is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly nature nineteenthcentury gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of mediaeval knights with their elaborate codes of chivalry both gwyneth paltrow and jeremy northam play their parts very well but this is not negreally one of the great screen romancesof the other characters i liked juliet stephensons vulgar mrs elton and toni collettes harriet i know that in the novel harriet was a nave young teenager whereas here she is more like the character collette played in muriels wedding a gauche slightly overweight twentysomething fretting about her chances of finding a man nevertheless i felt that this characterisation worked well in the context of the film and did not negdetract from austens themesemma is one of austens more lighthearted works without the darker overtones of mansfield park or even pride and prejudice and this is reflected on screen we see a world of beauty and grace full of stately homes and elegant costumes and fine manners apart from the ruffianly gypsies who make a very brief appearance the only poor people we see are mrs bates and her daughter and as they live in the sort of picturesque rosestrewn thatched cottage which today would change hands for over  we can be sure that their poverty is relative not negabsolute in emmas world poverty is defined as not neghaving your own stately home this is of course not nega comprehensive picture of early nineteenthcentury life but nobody neghas ever claimed austen as the regency equivalent of a kitchensink realist sophisticated romantic comedy combined with a keen eye for analysing human character was more in her linei would not negrate this film quite as highly as the  sense and sensibility or the recent pride and prejudice it tends to drag a bit in the middle although it has a strong beginning and strong ending but it is in the main a highly enjoyable austen adaptation,0

i think its a great movie because you get to see how dianas life at home is she got so much aggression and she wants to prove that girls can fight too i think she and adrian were great actors because of this movie i am boxing too it really impressed me the only negative part i think is the end because its alright between diana and adrian but you dont negget to see how it is at home and i didnt negreally like it that you also dont negget to see how her father is doing and her brother but i think it was a great movie and i think im going to watch it a lot more i recommend it to anyone even when you dont neglike boxing you get to see a lot more than only boxing i had a great time watching it,1
being an otaku since the days of robotech i can still say that gunbuster is one of my favorite animes of all time considering when it was made the animation is of superior quality there are no negloops and sequences in which the art decreases in quality although the final episode is in black and white it does not negdetract from the enjoyment of watching the film although it has been described as being sappy it should be kept in mind that females do not negreact in the same way that males do since the main character is a female it should be obvious that she does not negnecessarily need to resort to machoman tactics in order to gain the respect of her peers the seiryuu for noriko incidentally also plays akane in ranma  noriko is as dimensional a cartoon can get her personality captures the essence of a spirited girl who seems at first to be completely helpless but in the end succeeds through the strength of her will the only complaint i have is that the mecha looked somewhat like teddy bears even the gunbuster utilizes a rather dubious homing laser and buster shield which is nothing negmore than having the machine wrap a giant velvety cloak around itself in true dracula style technique i doubt that scene was meant to be funny but it cracked me up yet all in all i would rank gunbuster in the top  anime of all time,1

the concept for sarafina appears to be a sound one that is aside from the musical perspective it attempts to combine upbeat african music with a story describing the atrocious conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time the film was set the contradictions of each of the two elements are too glaring and the film never negjustifies such rapid shifts between jubilation and terror had it simply been a drama reflecting these conditions it may have been a good film however the scenes of school children being shot down by soldiers dont negexactly sit well next to the songs aside from the poor premise the acting isnt negthe best either goldberg gives a mediocre performance as does the remainder of the cast overall a disappointment,0
i had seen this movie when it got released and when i was  years old  and i still vividly recollect the wonderful scenes of how the heroheroine escape every time when faced with danger  and the best feature of the movie was the portrayal of the villain i think many socalled action movies copied a lot many escape scenes from this movie and not negonly does it never negimpress me when i see such copying it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece  the lead actors have acted wonderfully the slow and realistic development of the chemistry bw the hero and heroine was extremely natural and wonderfully portrayed as children we felt that the love that developed bw them was very natural  the way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations together was something that can make even kids realize the value of true love sacrifice and caring i recommend that every person see this movie when given a chance vijay,1
just finished watching the movie and wanted to give my own opinionand justice to the moviefirst of all to get things straight this movie is not negpretending to be anything other than a solid action comedy movie it doesnt negaim to revolutionize the movie industry and garner critical acclaims nor negdoes it want to be regarded as one if you really want to enjoy this movie to the fullest i suggest you discard your criticalmindedness and your longing for a good plot because you wont negfind any in here with that established let us further into the moviei had low expectations for this movie simply because it didnt neghave a strong plotyes moviegoers i underrated this movie as well but i never negexpected myself to enjoy this movie that much i even enjoyed this more than the stephen chow flickswhich i find kung fu hustle to be his best effort and wouldve rated it a  as well action is tight and epic while comedy chokes on to the right placesspoilers alert i think the action might be unreal but why would i want to watch a serious basketball movie anyways there are a lot other sports moviesdrama that already did it well why create another spoilers endim not negeven sure why youre reading this go ahead and watch it just remember no negthinking  just watch enjoy smile laugh and every once in a while theythe movie industry creates masterpieces such as pulp fiction or the godfather movies and sometimes they create movies which are better off in the pile of dump im not negsaying kung fu dunk deserves the recognition that the previous examples have then again if were talking about stephen chowish comedy this ones a top tenhighly recommended if you love no negbrainer movies with really good action kung fu death trance kung fu and comedy what the heck watch this youll have a great time for you the cast of kung fu dunk,1
there is a scene near the beginning after a shootout where horses are running if something red catches your eye it is because a white van is parked behind a bush by the trail i thought i had seen bad but this is it a white van in a western did they not negcatch this oh well and i paid top dollar at the rental it will make you want to grab your buddies and have them all put in  grand and make a better movie the talking was so so slow the acting was mostly ok but couldnt negbe taken seriously due to the poor nature of the filming there is a door at the sheriffs that looks like a door today with the particular trimming i say watch this movie and move cabin boy into  on the worst of all time,0
nothing negto say but wow has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field well this happens about  times in this movieclearly the directors favorite scare tactic in one of the opening scenes the smooth talkinghot shot producer has to ride in the back seat so the camera man could sit in the front to film shortly after he arrives to the field the  contestants show up and although it is clearly at latest  in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute after about  minutes of boobless trash we are privileged with a flashback of the clowns history in which we see some of his previous victims if you watch this movie check out the ladies chest her ribs go all the way to her neck it was flat out disgusting most horror movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day the few night shots that did make it in to the movie look like they were stolen from the blair witch project or random shots from the directors backyard the movie somewhat redeemed itself in the end when there was a matrix like shoot out with the clown that we rewound and watched over and over laughing hystericallydefinitely rent this movie if you have ever been snuck up on in an open fieldsigned the answer,1
the movie starts something like a less hyperkinetic more pastiche dead or alive strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered by police officers but when a police officer is killed one tatsuhito gets involved and when he discovers that his brother shihito is also involved things get bloody quite fastan earlier work of miikes shinjuku triad society is still filled with his usual in the ol ultraviolence and sadistic sex acts though its not negone of his more eclectic or flamboyant pieces rather its a pretty well crafted bit of pulp fiction as tatsuhito digs his way through the underground a maze that leads him to a gay triad leader who sells illegally gained body organs from taiwan and keeps an almostbrothel of young boys one in particular the character who kills the cop at the beginning tatsuhitos brother is getting involved with said society so tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate into this sordid realmwhats mainly interesting about this little bit of work is the relationship tatsuhito has with his nemesis wang tatsuhito is a japanese born in china later moved back into japan and alienated for it wang is a chinese who felt alienated in china so killed his father and developed a crime wing in japan wang also is a surprisingly shakespearian character which is weird enough as it is much less that you actually begin to feel sorry for him by the time his ultimate showdown with tatsuhito comes to be and tatsuhito himself is a similarly tragic figure when hes forced to contend with his lack of ability to control his brother while it would be rude to state that miikes movies are successful mostly on their shock value it is true that sometimes its easy to lose track of how well miike can create bitter disimpassioned characterspolarisdib,1

i am currently sitting here forcing myself to finish this i figure i blew  bux on the vhs might as well suffer for it i remember about  or  years ago doing a search on the internet for war of the worlds cause of the rumors of the spielberg movie at the time and i missed the old tv series from the early s the website make it out that this was a multimillion dollar budget rendition of the classic book it was going to be a perfect translation perfect crap is more in tune with this filmfirst off the video on this movie was glitched it looked as if i was watching the full motion video from an old mids pc or playstation cdrom video game sadly enough the color quality was similar the acting made shatners classic dramatic pause look damn near shakespearean in quality the cg rendering of various scenes was horrendous and green screen sequences were worse than those seen in old dukes of hazardd scenessecondly it is slow and terribly drawn out i sat thru  minutes of the video no negpromos at the beginning before the cylinder actually opened to reveal the first alien after that the alien was a terribly constructed cg squid i am now an hour into it and the most of the alien weaponry i have seen is a spinning silver disk crappy down even attached to a mechanical arm the dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done instrumentals the last thing on that for an alien invasion in the turn of the century s no negone is concerned for their life its like they have no negconcept even though media was slow word of mouth spreads fast and people would have known the illusion of day and night was shoddy at best simply changing the color around the people to purple blue or green does not negsignify night time perhaps some lighting and actual night time shoots would have given a much better illusion there is a lot of wasted sequences throughout the film of just watching the hero gallop around or walk down silly roads get on with the film i know how people get around you do not negneed to be so indepthnow finally an hour and  minutes into the film and they show the alien machines mighty morphin power rangers had better looking effects even the skeletons of vaporized humans looked as if animated by a freshman high school computer app class student the animations do not negmatch up to the scenery at allin closing folks if you want the war of the worlds do one of four things  watch the  original  watch the early s tv series  wait for spielbergs rendition to be released shortly or  read the frikkin book something we all probably did in elementary english class avoid this movie it is a waste of your money,1
its this one very cool premise right off the bathas an excellent first scene gotta give credit where credits duehas solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me whenever negthe ghosts appeared which i really liked by the way how it was done how it lookedthe only thing was the ghosts relationship because of the way things went down in the first scene youd think their dynamic would be differentthings slowed down a little too much in the middle i felt and the crabspider scene was just not neggood but then the ending is actually very good sure the grudge basically told the same story with a polished lens but no negsamurais and thats what i liked about this movie comparativelyplease someone one with a tempered style remake this moviefans of silent rage would absolutely love this movie,1
america a land of freedom of hope and of dreams this is the nation that since its independence has striven to bring democracy prosperity and peace to the entire world for the good of all mankind there are times however when one cannot neghelp but wish that the americans would just stay on their side of the atlantic this movie and i use that word with some reservations evokes these feelings with an intense purity this vision of hell follows the adventures of calvin a freakish jewel thief who was created by attaching the severed head of marlon wayan onto the body of a two foothigh dwarf after inadvertently dropping a large diamond into the handbag of vanessa a careerwoman who is reluctant to have children calvin realises that in order to recover the diamond he must ingratiate himself with her so as any normal man would calvin dresses himself up as a  yearold and parks himself upon the poor womans doorstep where he is discovered by darryl the broody husband of vanessa darryl incongruously falls for calvins disguise despite the fact that the baby has a full set of teeth stubble a tattoo a knifescar and the sexdrive of a yearold even more absurdly vanessa doesnt negsee past calvins babywear either and actually attempts to breastfeed the diminutive pervert this wretched assault upon the soul of mankind attempts and fails to find humour in rape scatology sexual assault and paedophilia however in a dishonest attempt to transform itself into a piece of familyentertainment the wayan brothers stir in a sickening amount of sentiment and flawed morality the brothers dim attempt a freudian rehabilitation of their thieving rapist by revealing that he had a bad father repeatedly hitting darryl in the crotch enables calvin to develop the loving fatherson relationship that both he and darryl have always wished for as if this wasnt negridiculous enough calvins attempts to sexually assault vanessa somehow convince her that it is selfish for a woman to indulge herself with a successful career and that instead she should spend her life playing the role of the housebound littlewoman who spends her time alternatively squeezing out babies and cooking for her husband in this movie the wayan brothers have mixed their crass and twisted form of humour together with the clichd sentimentality that has infected much of hollywoods recent body of work additionally they are endemic of the current generation of black comedians who are responsible for transforming africanamerican humour into a poor and wretched shadow of itself that overindulges in fartjokes and crude sexual gags by rights these two should be legally barred from picking up anything even remotely resembling a camera ever again unfortunately the current artistic and moral bankruptcy of american cinema means that by this time next month they will undoubtedly have filmed two sequels and be making millions of dollars from tacky merchandising deals,1
i shall not negwaste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad that has been done in great detail already many times over the plot started out as a very uninspiring cockney wideboygangsterbynumbers bore and very quickly descended into an utter shambles anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves it is now  or  years since i watched it during its  week run at the cinema before it was pulled yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film i have ever seeni am only making these comments and indeed the only reason i went to see the film is because of the amusing fact that my brother eddie appeared in it as the second heavy in the pub scene it was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards rhys ifans face in the bar in russia it was actually filmed at the former butlins holiday camp at barry island my brother has absolutely no negacting experience whatsoever  he had recently joined an extras agency and this was his first part having seen the film it appeared that nobody negin it required any acting experience whatsoeveri remember there were about  people in the whole cinema  and this was just a couple of days after it had been released i have never negheard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast  and rightly so in case you were thinking of renting this film on dvd i would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are redhot then jam them into your eye sockets this will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film,0

the pilot of enterprise has one thing that has been lacking since the original star trek a dose of realistic flawed personalities the utopian characters of the next generation got tiring they were so noble as to be unbelievable i also like the subplot that humans are bitter toward the vulcans its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs it makes me look forward to seeing when the humans become the dominant race between the two though i dont negthink it would work in the time frame of the show the only negatives that jumped out at me were the quick cut off the ending at  hours feel of the end which is common among many of the trek shows the second was the shameless dig for ratings by a couple of senselessly sexy scenes it was out of place a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pad the preteen audience with some skin but its not negmy job to make the show profitable so oh welllets see how the next episode does,1

the third installment of the carnosaur trilogy features a bunch of keystone kopsquality military commandos trying to kill two velociraptors and a trex i give it a  out of sheer sympathy and my affinity for dinosaurs the movie is definitely the worst of the trilogy it really cant negbe taken seriously more significantly however watching this movie i cant neghelp but notice some interesting parallels between the carnosaur and xtro trilogies the first installment in both franchises is a dark disturbing film that has become a cult classic the second is an alien ripoff and the third is a tongueincheek almost slapstick whether intentional or not movie that has you rolling on the floor laughing also like the xtro franchise all the carnosaur movies are completely unrelated to one another they they only carry the franchise name to drum up interest in the sequels i guess obviously carnosaur and xtro have two different production groups at work here but if youve seen all three movies of both franchises you find yourself referring back and forth between the two,0
doghi is a wonderful movie and renuka daftardar is excellent so is uttara baokar who is usually excellent in most of her roles along with kairee its an example of marathi cinema at its best there are certain parts in both movies that tend to the didactic  it would have probably enhanced the movie to not neghave the few scenes where the social message is hammered in these scenes probably emerge from the filmmakers political concerns but the movie is realistic and moving enough to not negneed it but apart from such minor negquibbles its a movie that deserves to be seen more and one i strongly recommend sumitra bhaves concern and humanism shines through,0
cradle of fearthis isnt nega movie where intricate delicate little narrative nuances occupy our attention this is not nega film where the special effects are supposed to leave us slackjacked uttering that sense of whoa what it is though is a slice of lofi goth horror which leaves little to the imagination created in the eyes of the director alex chandon as a throwback to sleazy s and s horrorthis is a very visceral experience for  hours where four plot lines are connected through lots of watery blood reams of dismembered body parts and innards tied by an intestinal thread of revenge the purveyor of such horrific violence is dani filth leadsinger of the metal band cradle of filth executing a role he was destined to play as others have said there is nothing negnew about wanting to carryout occultist revenge in this particular context a convicted sexual predator and murderer kemper the father of our devilish avengingangel compels his son to exact retribution on those who are some how connected to convicting him to purgatory within an insane asylumwhat this provides for the chandon who should be congratulated on also penning and editing this piece is the opportunity to let his sick mind run free he seems to take delight in the idea of splattering blood into the orifices of those on screen and into every nook and cranny that can be reached we are also treated to closeups of skulls being crushed demonic rape and other assorted imagery to engage those who relish getting up close and personal to their horror and for some of those who closely follow these type of films there is the odd sequence which may have you thinking did i just see what i thought i did because of course pretty woman this aint it reminds me of some of the gorefests created out of italian horror some  to  years ago and a number of other works where disgusting images have left their mark but not negthe context in which they were viewedstory  of the set is particularly intriguing where the idea of ones obsession can ultimately lead to death in the pursuit of internet violence through the sick room where the user is in control of how a life can be snuffed out further acknowledgements should also go out to a pounding soundtrack that allows filth to exercise his daytime talent and an effective use of drum and bass often overlooked in filmmaking as a viable form of supporting visuals using the city of london as a backdrop with real people as opposed to movie standins also adds support to the commando feel of the film ok classic it may not negbe but blood guts intestines occult and demons in a slightly perverse unproblematic way it is,1
following the success of the awful gilligans island tv movie reruns a number of tv movies were made in the s reuniting casts from classic shows most of these movies completely missed the boat as far as recapturing the humor that made the shows so special the munsters revenge is among the most disappointing because it goes for a laurel and hardytype comedy style that really wasnt negin the original series yvonne de carlo a wonderful comedienne and essential to the series is completely wasted  she has less time here in this  minute movie than she did in any single  minute episode and since the roles of eddie and marilyn in this movie are nothing negmore than cameos what was the point of making them younger and recasting them with very little rewriting they could have used butch patrick and pat priest although seeing some of the munsters spooky relatives was a nice touch i didnt negenjoy sid caesar as the hammy mad scientist mainly because theres too much of him and not negenough of the underused munsters ironically that very year  caesars old partner in comedy imogene coca was also inappropriately cast in a major part in a tv movie reunion return of the beverly hillbillies another strange inexplicable bit at the beginning of the film has the munster family represented as wax figures at a local horror wax museum why would they be in there when they are supposed to be a typical if strange american family not negfamous monsters this was the last munsters project featuring the original cast in their roles there was an awful revival of the series in the late s with a completely new cast and a s tv movie which featured decarlo lewis priest and patrick in cameo roles as a family dining,0
i cant negsay that this film deserves anywhere near the amount of vitriol being heaped on it by some reviewers yes its bogged down by an overlypadded running time hamfisted editing and an overreliance on cheeseball special effects and it lacks much of the energy a comedy needs to get your average audience member to sit through it without checking his or her watch on the other hand its also got some laughoutloud funny lines a talented and earnest cast and the classic underdog premise macy stiller and azaria are brilliant as the core team and garofalo and studi do superb work adding conflict and variety to the team i cant negsay reubens or mitchell added much to the film overall though each had a few chances to shine the plot as i said above is your classic underdogmakesgood stuff no negsurprises there since you know theyre going to triumph what makes it worthwhile is not negthe absurd gaudy heroes and villains but the dialogue and interplay between the characters underneath it all these people are children at heart who just want to do right the best scenes in the film give this film its emotional grounding look at azarias relationship with his longsuffering mother macys endearing innocence in his unwillingness to accept cap amazings secret identity stillers rage not negunlike that one weird spazzy kid you once knew whod always go into quivering impotent rages on the playground garofalos desire to avenge her father this childlike belief that a sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place is the true appeal of superhero comics and underneath its parodic exterior mystery men shows us why these hackneyed comicbook tropes matter to so manyit never negreally gels into a satisfying whole due to the huge number of halfbaked subplots romance family life conflicts within the team etc but the main plot is such loopy fun that it makes up for that the fact that its supposed to be good nonsensical fun seems to be lost on some of the reviewers here so ill issue a caveat if youre the type of viewer who finds his enjoyment of an itchy and scratchy cartoon ruined by the unexplained and illogical am i to believe this is some sort of snort magic xylophone then you are far too literalminded and humorless for this film go rent a sandler film instead,0
out of  people found this comment useful and countingpeople are such suckers for image and looks  as much as for the intellectually hollow idealism that lurks behind communism ches charisma and looks have as much to do with his iconic stature as the misinformation that has been spread by leftist propaganda such as this movie about himi dont negknow whats worse being captured by one of ches murdersquads or having to sit through  hours of this typically soderberghian garbage the question isnt negwhy this petproject was made but what took them so long by them im referring of course to leftwing hollywood and its secret love of marxist tyrants lenin castro take your pick i am fascinated that it took decades for one of tinseltowns least talented liberal directors to finally take on such an irresistibly biased propaganda project where was oliver stone all these years robert redford tim robbins warren beatty alan pakula george clooney barbra streisand even its a mystery all these overrated artists have often indulging themselves in similar politically onesided projects yet somehow che guevara who is arguably the most popular and wellknown communist hasnt negbeen a film topic of theirs yetguerrilla has all the hallmarks of an american truthbending story of an epic scale there is as much factual detail to be found here as in other similar hollywood bigbudget political fairytale bios such as malcolm x or gandhi ie almost none the movie stars del toro as the famous argentinian revolutionary nevertheless however controversial and criminal this mans actions may have been one thing nobody negcould take away from him he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family  which is why del toro fits the bill only visually del toro may be an interesting charismatic actor and he may resemble guevara physically but he exudes no negintellectual qualities whatsoever hence he makes guevara come off as too primitive casting such mediocrities as bratt philips and franka incompetente only underlines the directors lack of sound judgmentthe movie is to the most part extremely slow no negsurprise there and visually uninteresting even a director as brilliant as kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the hour mark so its quite telling that this soderbergh who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career would think that his oceanic grandness was up to the task if you think the films length indicates that a bulk of ches life has been shown here  then think again soderbergh focuses on ches last phase and a lot of the movie is tedious jungle nonsense full of guevaras alleged idealism psychopaths dont neghave ideals i do wonder what kind of a mind this highly esteemed director has to have to actually choose to ignore some of ches earlier life did he actually consider it too uninteresting a massacre of  people holds no neginterest for the viewer huh amazing some much better directors than this overpraised charlatan would have easily fit not negone but two complete biographies into a hour moviesoderbergh in a sense becomes an accomplice by never negaddressing the negative dark side  which is more than   of guevara by spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy consciously ignoring the ugly truth god forbid he should taint the holy image of che soderbergh proves himself not nega humanist  a fake image which most hollywood and pop music personalities struggle very hard all their careers to uphold  but the opposite that he cares only about ideas never negabout the people on whom these ideas are tested like on guinea pigs soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind such people often have a latent contempt for the proleteriat what a stupid term theyre supposedly siding withhalf of all students around the world wear ches image on their red and orange shirts but without ever knowing why he has become an iconic figure for clueless uninformed very often young people who think that by having this mans face on their chest that somehow makes them appear edgy intellectual hip or interesting in reality wearing a che shirt only underlines ones overall shallowness and total disinterest in selfeducation wouldnt negyou want to find out more about a person before you start advertising hisher face to the world wearing ches bynow clich image has

as an avid fan of the flashman books by george mcdonald fraser i looked forward immensely to seeing flashy on the big screen when this film was first released sadly it was a huge disappointment then  so i left it alone for  years before going back to watch it again but it was no negbetter the second time mr fraser is a tremendously skillful writer but i am not nega fan of his film screenplay work with richard lester the penchant for slapstick spoilt the three musketeers for me and the same applies here to me the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong the flashman books are uproariously funny in parts but they are adventure novels there is much seriousness in the way the adventures that flashman has  after all he is involved in dangerous situations this is conveyed in the novels but not negconveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style it is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book when i first read that the book was to be filmed the article said that the film was to star oliver reed i rejoiced as reed to me was the epitome of flashman how i would have loved to see him in the role malcolm mcdowell is a good actor but does not negfit the visual image of flashman created by the books too scrawny looking flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow neverheless reed was excellent as bismarck what kills the film is that it is made as a comedy the only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which flashman kills de gautet tom bell a great shame as the production values costumes sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent  just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from malcolm mcdowell possibly the directorship of richard lester was responsible for the way the film is as a recent radio adaptation of flash for freedom adapted by mr fraser worked quite well perhaps one day we may see flashman done justice on screen,1
ive just finished viewing the st disc in a disc  episodes collection created in conjunction with the ucla film  television archive smore entertainment inc so far aside from the st episode the image quality is quite good the dvd box is shown on the title page here on imdbmr peepers is just as charming as when i first saw it years old at the time and wally cox is truly endearing in this role if youre in the mood for quiet comedy that sneaks up on you as opposed to hitting you over the head youll treasure this chance to experience all the wonderful characters you might remember from your childhood although some of the gags are a bit corny most are ingenious and wellexecutedand even the corny ones are fun this is one tv series that lives up to my early childhood memories of it,0
i was never nega big fan of horror movies they usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children they usually lack originality and contain overacting galore the only horror movie i like was stir of echoes with kevin bacon it was wellacted and had a great story but it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by stanley kubricks the shining quite possibly the scariest movie everthe movie follows a writer jack nicholson and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter there were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family but jack is convinced it will be ok and he can use the quiet to overcome his writers block after months of solitude and silence however jack becomes a grumpy and later violent is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him madone of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that kubrick makes the hotel is very silent and the rooms are huge yet always empty it is also eerily calm when jacks son is riding his bike through the barren hallways jack nicholsons performance is also one of his very best scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile my favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walkin refrigeratorthe shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion beating the snot negout of crap like the ring and the blair witch project it may be a oldie but is definitely a goodie,0
kidnappings in mexico are as common as honeys giving me their phone numbers so if youre rich then youll need a good bodyguard to keep you and your kids safe a couple hires a washed up bodyguard called creasy to protect their adorable kid pita at first their relationship is a tad buggy but after a while creasy eases up to the girl and the two develop a fatherdaughter relationship one day pita is kidnapped and creasy is badly injured in the process when he wakes up he finds out that the girl has been killed due to a ransom negotiations that went wrong and this sets creasy on a path find the men responsible for her death and make sure they are brought to his brand of justicekeep some tylenol next to you while watching this movie because you will need to take some after watching it i really love the story here of going to the extreme to obtain revenge because most movies usually just want revenge but really never neggo too far where as this movie they show how far a man can go to do what he feels is right the only problem is the annoying visual style which will either make you hate the movie or hate tony scott i really feel sorry for the cinematographer because im sure he came into this movie thinking he was going to be filming an action movie and probably got all excited but instead he got stuck being the dp for a filmmaker that feels that the whole movie should look like its been possessed by demons i wouldnt neghave mind if the crappy visuals were restricted to a few action scenes but when its spread through out the whole movie then thats when we have some problems the same annoying style was recently used on domino and much like with this movie the style did hurt that otherwise great movieanother person i feel sorry on this movie was the soon to be great harry gregson williams who had the impossible task of trying to compose music out of the jagged images somehow williams wrote some decent music for the movie but im sure if the movie had been more stable then the music would have turned out a lot better the sound is wrongfully used throughout the movie and instead of enhancing the movie experience it rather makes you feel like youre being punished the overuse of the subwoofer is irritating as every  seconds or so you can hear an ungodly low end sound coming out of it i dont negknow why scott thought the audience needed to be bombarded by the subwoofer but it really takes you away from the moviethe acting in the movie is a beast despite the visuals little fanning does yet another great job here and the scene at the end of the movie just breaks my heart if the end of the movie doesnt negmake anyone cry then theyre dead on the inside denzel washington breaks his rule of not negmaking any action movies with this movie and luckily for him he gets to play a great character the whole idea of a man thats lost in life and all of a sudden due to a tragedy finds a purpose in his life is nothing negnew but washington brings some heart and emotion to the otherwise flat character i love how we witness him from being a loner to actually learning to have emotion and after the kidnapping becoming a cold instrument of revenge radha mitchell plays marc anthonys wife and she along with fanning are the two reasons why i cant neghate the movie too much jlos husband comes and goes in the movie but he doesnt negreally stand out much mickey rourke and chris walken all have minimal roles in the movie but they do make an impactone thing that makes me laugh is how the filmmakers try to makeup for the crappy way they portray mexico by calling it a fine city at the end of the movie a little too late for that if you ask me lets hope that tony scott is done with this phase of intentionally trying to ruin his career because a filmmaker as talented as him can and must do better than this,1
after star wars a new hope redefined science fiction and the empire strikes back redefined star wars its hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two but this one really does a nice job the first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and whats going on in the war there is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellions final confrontation with the emperor when the battle begins the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films this climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy with the most at stake for the rebellion this is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land including han solo chewbacca and leia the battle raging on in space including lando and a confrontation between luke and the emperor on the new death star which leads up to another duel with darth vader it is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war and there seems to be no negescape although i think the idea of ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit farfetched it didnt negseem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers although they did have some luck fighting them there is also a twist or two at the end that nobody negsaw coming which may not negbe quite as stunning as that of the empire strikes back but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well with the light tone of a new hope and the more sinnister tone of the empire strikes back this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale the special edition for return of the jedi concentrated on what would have been nice to change since not negmuch of the original really needed it fifteen years of technology advancements didnt negseem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned and there still is the occasional disappearing tie fighter but other than that it was good the gaping nonthreatening sarlaacs mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge flytrap looking head that emerged which definitely added to the suspense also the disco was taken out of jabbas palace and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy instead of just a small ewok village which was the case of the original and that didnt negreally end a story this big the way it deserved its hard to say which of the three films was the best but since its all part of the same story the overall trilogy is like one big outstanding film a third mustsee for film fans,1
watching tom hanks as a hit man for the irish mob is a little like seeing jimmy stewart as a serial rapist it just doesnt negwork i had a really hard time accepting thisnot negthat i dont negthink tom cant negact he can ive been following his career since mazes and monsters but for some reason this fell flat for me maybe because im such a fan of the graphic novel and at the risk of sounding like a fanboythe only form of life lower than a fanboy is a cockroachthe movie as a whole fails for methe additions jude law and the subtractions everything else left me feeling cold and more than a little disappointed i was expecting a great crime movie more in the vein of bonnie and clyde mendes took all the heart out of the story and left us with nothing negbut the bare bones there are things to like in this flick however the cinematography is breathtaking filling the screen with beautiful images paul newman is as usual excellent and i really did enjoy the score but tom as the angel of death sullivan was completely flat,0
this movie makes me want to throw up every time i see it if you take the first movie and reverse the plot ariel wants to leave the sea her daughter wants to go to the sea take the same characters and give them new animals and new names and then throw in crappy animation and the biggest suck factor possible you get the little mermaid  its basically a copy of the first movie with a reversed plot ill take you through the horror of it step by step these are the people from the st movie first of all prince eric is still prince eric with about  lines in the whole movie ariel is uptight annoying and is not negthe carefree headstrong spirit we saw in the st in fact she is the exact opposite sebastian is still sebastian only less cute less convincing as being stressed out and the jokes just arent negfunny anymore flounder has about  lines he now has kids and he talks with a dumb nasal voice scuttle is still dumb scuttle only not negfunny king tritons character is probably the best he still retains the intimidation and love for his daughter melody ariel and prince eric appear not negto give a hoot about their daughter like i said all they did was use the characters from the first movie and copy them this is what they did ursula the new evil villain is morgana ursulas sister who feels like she always lived in ursulas shadow i wouldnt negbe scared of her if she showed up at my doorway with a knife she cant negdo anything right and shes a failure as a villain she has the same voice ursula did sebastian  flounder  have been replaced by probably the most stupid sidekicks tip  dash a walrus and a penguin they try to be heros but always fail when trying the plot is so predictable they become heroes at the end yawn flatson jetsom now replaced by a shark who was turned about x smaller by triton hes really bad too morgana and the shark sharkbait i think was his name have no negchemistry good or bad arielah ariel our lovely mermaid was replaced by her unlovely daughter melody melody cannot negsing her voice is about  octaves higher than it should be and you want to punch her in the face because shes so fake sugary sweet she wants to go to the sea she is clumsy and the kids make fun of her she has to go find herself yawnnot negonly is the movie boring and unoriginal its so simplistic when you watch this movie you will gasp at how bad it is certain parts of the movie make you want to call disney up and demand why such a horrible movie was made as a sequel to such a wonderful originalbasically comparing the little mermaid  to the little mermaid is like comparing and ed wood movie to casablanca dont negever watch this not negeven when your bored,1
as long as theres been d technology s i think theres been animation made for it i remember specifically a donald duck cartoon with chip and dale in it i dont negremember the name at the moment but the plot was that donald worked at a circus was feeding an elephant peanuts and chip and dale were stealing the peanuts this was made to watch in d probably s if you happened to watch meet the robinsons in d in theaters they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of its origin there are probably somewhere around  cartoons made specifically to be viewed through d glasses this claim was a bad move because its not negdifficult to prove them wrong on top of that this just looks like a bad movie,1
most horror movies are in fact horrible movies they get to be same olsame ol same ol pack every minute with some cheap thrill usually splatter and nowadays they can pack every second with gaudy special effects one of the goals of a really good horror flick is to suspend the sense of disbelief of the audience for instance i saw both of the recent mummy movies and nearly got dizzy viewing ridiculous special effects every second it probably costs a million dollars per second to make those movies and my sense of disbelief was never negsuspended it grew rootssubtlety can be more terrifying less is more i first saw the woman in black on the ae channel after flipping through the usual  channels of very bad television i stopped to watch it this movie almost has the feel of a masterpiece theater production that was fine with me ive always preferred british tv  movies anywaymost viewers would find this to be too slowly paced but the slow pacing helps give the story credibility the special effects are few which lulls the viewer into thinking that this film is set in the real world thus making us a bit more uneasy the makeup and costume for the ghost are kept simple and believable hollywood would have made her look like a she demon from hell with glowing eyesfangsclaws etc hollywood would have done an overkill and turned this idea into a mediocritythe woman only makes about five appearances in the film most of them are where she appears in the distance and even that creates a good fright if she appeared too often it couldve cheapened the mood that gets set however this movie is so well made that through much of the film were led into sensing that she is there the whole time but not negvisible the scene where she visits arthur kidd late at night and we see her just a little too close is a masterpiece in horrorthis is just an extraordinary film that i think should rate as one the finest horror films ever made i have a copy of the haunting the changling and a zillion more i havent negseen anything that tops the woman in black yet although im still looking this movie is so well made that it gives even the most hardened skeptic like me a moment where i almost had second thoughts about the nonexistence of ghosts i joke to people that i occasionally get brief fears that she could appear standing in the middle of the road or that id see her staring through my window etc maybe she could be in a crowd at the mall glaring at me with her look of hate this is how a really great horror film should be like a lafanu novel the woman in black very slowly pulls you in and wraps herself around your neck and before you realize it shes squeezing the life out of you and then its too lateclosest thing i have to a criticism is that this was made for the small screen and its a terrible shame that this is out of print i just paid over  for my second copy of this movie its a major prize in my collection now im on a quest to find an even better horror movie that not negonly gives the chills but also qualifies a sound drama,1
this movie consists of such great emotion especially with its outstanding soundtrack that coincides with the film tom cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm to make films and to entertain this movie was not negthe best the first time i watched it but after about  more times i decided that this is one of the best films that i have ever seen it takes place in new york and progresses on through his lifestyle he discovers a delimma in his life with his girlfriend diaz he goes through a state of depression and then an outgoing blend of imagination this film was beyond my expectations and is one of cruises best films ever,1

liam neeson portrays the scottish legend robert roy macgregor from the early th century he is a true actor he captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles jessica lange is excellent as his wife mary mary is such a beautiful woman its her love that makes rob roy the legend but its his passion that makes her love undying they need each other tim roth as the evil cunningham is perfect in one way or another upon watching the movie you will find cunningham disgusting the scotland scenery is beautiful the environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well if you like history romance passion and love youll enjoy rob roy there is violence and blood but its unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told no neggratuitous violence and you do have to listen carefully if youre not negused to a scottish accent one important point that makes this movie so good is that no negone actor or actress is glamorized they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes its their skill as actors that attracts you they dont negrely on marquee names popularity or sex symbol appeal this is something special,1

spoilerstom and jerry is a classic cartoon with a flawless idea and almost every single short is a gem while i must say that this is definitely an inferior short compared such other classic tom and jerry shorts there is not negway you can hate this cartoon sure it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first tom and jerry episodes and i can say that i agree but the fact of the matter is that all tom and jerry episodes are great but some are just better than others well this would fit into others here is the plot of fraidy cat tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast and becomes easily frightened jerry observes how scared he is and tries to scare him even more than he already is he creates scary dilemmas for tom and tom becomes scared out of his wits and his lives jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it thus making it look like the vacuum is a ghost tom finds out that jerry did all of this and chases him tom then accidentally bites the house maid however at the end jerry ends up the one becoming scared after he sees his reflection in a flour cupoverall this is far from the best tom and jerry short out there but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time it makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this the slapstick and gags in this that make tom and jerry famous are as good as ever in this short but it felt like something was missing in this it felt slower than most tom and jerry shorts anyway this is a good short that does not negquite live up to some other tom and jerry cartoons but it is still nice,0
when it first came out this work by the meysels brothers was much criticized and even judged to be exploitation luckily it is now hailed as a masterpiece of documentary cinema especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in what is reality television and the bad evolution of most direct cinemareally at first we must say that this isnt negreally direct cinema it is more cinema verit the difference between the two is very slight but it mainly is the fact that in this documentary we are made to feel the presence of the meysels brothers and they do interact with the characters filmed this as well makes it clear that it is not negexploitation the meysels have been allowed in the house and they are included in what is a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household and both edith and edie just love the idea of being filmedit would have been very disappointing had very been shown only a voice of god narration and shallow interviews here we are given a full portrait of the madness of the house a madness that does seem to go down well with both edie and her mother edith their house is a mess litter and animals everywhere faded colors and furniture all over the house and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality these two people have lived with each other their whole life and are not negfighting in front of the camera because they want the attention but rather because they cant neghelp talking to each other this way they know each other too well to hide their inner feelings there is no negneed in the end though even as they blame each other for their lives they really love each other deeply edie says she doesnt negwant her mother to die because she loves her very much and edith says that she doesnt negwant edie to leave her because she doesnt negwant to be alonebut the most interesting aspect of the film is that regardless of their old age the two women cant neghelp be girls they cannot neghelp being one the singer the other the dancer exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera when edie asks david meysels rhetorically where have you been all my life she is really very happy that she finally gets to show the whole world herself and her wonderful showgirls skills a beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a charm that is highly unlikely to be ever seen again the way only the meysels and few others could do,1

the haunted world of edward d wood jr isnt nega particularly good documentary aesthetically its lackluster and cheap looking the people in it go off on tangents which make it very unfocused and incohesive but this adds to its charm i say this because its a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow oddballs and as such theres really no negother way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits there are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of wood and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary overall its worth a watch for the wood fan and those of cinema in general but dont negexpect brilliance here expect a documentary made after woods own heart,1

nobody but nobody could chew the scenery like the divine one ruth elizabeth davis and elizabeth and essex is a great example why although she overplays the part at times watch her when she gawfs about raliegh writing the lyrics to a song her ladiesinwaiting are about to play in that one moment she makes us understand how elizabeth was able to rule and rule absolutely at other times she is done in by the scripts sappiness when elizabeth has to be vulnerable she comes off as weak and shrewish this has the added effect of undermining her authority when she blows her stack and threatens to dispense justice its hard to take her seriouslyflynn exudes charm making us see how essex was able to worm his way into elizabeths heart but he is totally inept at conveying the complexity and sheer evil of the man it also doesnt neghelp that essex is badly underwritten why is he this hothead who wants to overthrow his queen  even as he swears fidelity to her  except only that he is more blueblooded thus more worthy of rule and why does raliegh betray elizabeth by intercepting her and essexs letters hes in no negrisk of falling out of favor and we know where essex and his head is headed so why does he risk his own head by speeding up the inevitablewhat did curtiz do with all the  he was given he doesnt negeven bother to try to hide the fact that his battle scenes are shot on a sound stage he shouldve ended it with elizabeth the first time alone at the tower everything else that follows especially the final scene between her and essex is unnecessary the costumes are fantastic and is it me or does bette look exactly like susan sarandon,0
it is so sad even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like blood lake theres nothing negout there   the music they play in this is the funniest stuff ive ever heard i like the brother and sister in this movie they both dont negtry very hard to sound sarcastic when theyre saying stuff like my friends are going to be so jealous hey whats with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning thats retarded i practically ignored the second half of this my favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe the same exact sound for every chop,1

i usually try to be professional and constructive when i criticize movies but my god this was the worst movie i have ever seen bad acting bad effects bad script bad everything the plot follows a group of teen cliches on their way to a rave that takes place in broad daylight at a remote island however when the group arrives all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes determined to find out what happened to the rest of the partygoers the clan sets off on a mission through a zombieinfested forest during this crusade they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids they also meet up with jonathan cherry and some other survivors basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the house of the dead this fight came complete with cheesy hollywood violence redundant clips from the hotd video game and sloppy matrixesque camera rotations one of the characters even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others why not negbecause he was noble and brave but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled im supposed to feel sorry for this guyto sum it all up there is absolutely no negpoint in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is the theater i was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen and im sure the money i wasted seeing this piece of sht could easily cover the costs it took to make it grade f,1
id like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest crappiest movie ive ever seeni have no negidea whats wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings the only thing i can imagine is that people mustve voted during one or more conditions while being shitfaced  stoned out of their minds  theyve received hard cash for the votes  under gunpointi cant negbelieve i wasted a good  h  min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie,0
when watching this show you are not negquite sure whether it is the story or the acting that is more annoying first of all the storyline of each episode is very predictable the writers must have used every clich possible you can guess not negonly the general plot but the arrangement of the scenes and also the lines of each character making the show some sort of a collage of every police series out there on the top of it all comes the message of the show that the good are good and the bad are bad and that at the end of the day the good shall prevail and that we should all love each other be better man and better citizens all done in the most ostensible manner the actors as the vehicles of this message and nothing negmore than that will use a limited set of acting skills the i am a good carrying person smile the concerned look and the victory is ours body posture while the bad guys have the im a bad one frowning and the you caught me look followed by the im good for nothing negand i should be removed from society head banding this kind of also sums up the general development of each show true story or not the show is garbage yet another proof that producers dont neggive a st about viewers that we are all thought to be idiots well this series makes every possible attempt to idiotize the living brains out of you,0
i have always been interested in anything about bigfoot so when i was browsing around looking for a movie to rent this one caught my eye it was the worst  ive ever spent and i want my money back please dont negwaste your money on this this was one of the cheapest movies ive ever seen the entire movie was so incredibly boring and i found myself rolling my eyes a lot and i didnt negeven watch it all the way through i just got fed up with it the acting was horrible the effects were horrible everything was just really bad and tasteless it all added up to be a really bad boring movie and total waste of time and money i hope that one day theyll make a good movie about sasquatch but until then ill have to sit through countless cheap duds like this one to find the real masterpiece,0
the last i believe of the movies the boys made with hal roach this is also the last truly funny film they made before going to th century fox which so famously misued their talents although there are weak moments  the business with the lung tester for instance is a bit ah  overblown but worth having just to see dr jimmy finlayson  but on the whole this flick is a good summary of what the boys brought to the screen richard cramer uncredited appeared in other lh flicks and he is delightfully threatening here as the convict nick granger the scene where the boys have to eat their own synthetic meal looks good smells good and it probably tastes good eat it is one of my favorite moments in the oeuvre stan  ollie will always be pleasant companions in the lives of their millions of devoted fans,0
this is apparently the second remake of this film having been filmed before in  and  and in so many ways it reminds me of the later film a yank at oxford both films concern a conceited blowhard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both ultimately show the blowhard slowly learning about teamwork and decency in this film william haines is tom brown and his main rival bob is played by frances x bushman and in a supporting role is jack pickfordalways remembered as the brother of mary of these three pickford comes off the best as the sympathetic loser who becomes toms palhe actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the big game all the standard clichs are there and the movie because it was done so many times before and since offers few surprises however it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewingin my opinion for a better silent college film try harold lloyds the freshmanits football scenes are frankly more exciting and harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying tom brown the freshman is probably the best college picture you can find from the era another reason why brown at harvard is a lesser picture is that william haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again such as in westpoint and the smart set among othersand if youve seen one of these films youve seen them all well made but certainly not negoriginal and because it is just a rehash of his other films anyone giving the film a score of  is strongly advised to see these other filmsi just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on imdb from the  talk about overrated there are dozens and dozens of better filmshow this film got to be  is anyones guess,1
i have to say this is an awful movie for the mere fact that when you see this movie on the guide it is listed as a documentary as i watched it i started laughing thinking to myself does this guy actually expect me to believe this is real so i had to look it up and now see that it is a movie but now since it isnt nega documentary it is now a movie with bad acting so either way it is pretty bad i actually didnt negmake it to the end i had to shut it off i am a nyc police officer and felt that someone was trying to mislead people into thinking this is a documentary with the intentions of making money off of a terrible day for me and my coworkers so i took it a little personal maybe i was blinded by that and it isnt negas bad as i personally think it is everyone has their own opinion,1

this is short and to the point the story writing used for star trek hidden frontier is surprisingly good acting is all over the map but the main characters over the years seem to have worked at improving their skills it is hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost  years and will be coming to end midmay i will not negrehash what has already been said about the sets and graphics considering this is allvolunteer for no negprofit it is pretty amazingif this was being ranked as a professional production i would have to give it a  for a good story but terrible sets however as a fanbased production i have to give it an excellent rating as with the exception with a few other efforts this is in a league of its own for sheer volume i dont negthink this has been matched congratulations to the cast and crew for an effort that many admire,0

the fbi story  was warner bros  minute epic tribute to the famous criminal investigation agency from a book by don whitehead came a somewhat laborious screenplay by richard l green and john twist and was directed with only a modicum of flair by mervyn leroy however it did have splendid colour cinematography by joseph biroc and a helpful score by the studios musical magician max steinerthe movie charts the history of the bureau from its lowly beginnings in the twenties to modern times and its all seen through the recollections of aging fastidious agent chip hardesty james stewart as he relates his investigative experiences  in flashback  to a class of budding young agents but its all very longwinded and episodic and as it progresses it begins to look like a tv mini series instead of a major movie production as the young hardesty runs the american crime gamut from taking on such notorious criminal figures as baby face nelson ma barker dillinger etc to sorting out nefarious organisations like the ku klux klan nazi spy rings and the red menace and here it has to be said that only for the screen presence and appeal of its star the fbi story would probably have ended up a forgotten disaster moreover this is another problem with the picture  stewart is left to carry the entire movie almost on his own with the exception of vera miles  who has the thankless role of being his long suffering but devoted wife  he is surrounded by a cast of minor negplayers throughout you find yourself half expecting someone like robert ryan jack palance or even raymond burr to make a welcome entrance as a mobster or a police chief or whatever but nothing negquite as imaginative as that ever occurs pitythe film does however manage to give a good look inside the workings of the bureau with the help of stewarts narration we learn about the thousands of men and women who work for the organisation which includes the hundreds of agents in the field and we are also treated to a peek inside headquarters which houses the gigantic records section and we also get a glimpse of the chemists and fingerprint experts meticulously going through their daily choresanother plus for the movie is max steiners remarkable score heard over the titles is a powerful rousing and determined march while for the pictures gentler moments there is an attractive love theme but quite ingenious is the menacing and ominous march theme for the ku klux klan sequence and better still is the rhythmic latinamerican music the composer wrote for the south american scenes especially the exciting fandango like orchestrations for the arrival of the federal troops on horseback the fbi story was one of five scores the composer wrote in  which included samuel bronstons naval epic john paul jones the charming romcom cash mccall delmer daves seminal western the hanging tree and daves a summer place from which derived the young love theme  which was to become a major hit tune for steiner better known as theme from a summer placethe fbi story just about passes muster as a movie thanks to birocs rich colour cinematography steiners wonderful music and of course jimmie stewart who makes anything watchableclassic but implausible line from the fbi story as the bland nick adams who has just blown up a plane with  people on board including his mother is being led away handcuffed he turns to the arresting officer and blurts in case i get any mail you can send it to canyon city prison for the next month or so  after that you can send it to hell wow,0

here is the example of a film that was not negwell received when it was made but whose standing seems to be raising in time the tenant is quite an interesting work by polanski one of the first of his european exile it is set in paris and as in so many other exile films the city its streets the seine and especially the building where the action takes place play an important role it is just that polanski chooses his principal character not negto be an american as in frantic for example but a pole as himself was when going west there is actually a lot of personal commentary in this film made at what must have been a time of crisis in the directors life and the fact that he decided to play the lead role and does it masterfully may also be seen as some kind of exorcismits in a way a circular story the hero named trelkovsky rents an apartment in old parisian building inhabited by what seem to be first a well assorted team of grumpy old or just ridiculous neighbors the previous tenant tried to commit suicide by jumping out of the window of the flat and trelkovsky has just the time to visit her in the hospital before she dies and meet there her young and beautiful friend stella a spectacled isabelle adjani in her first role after truffauts lhistoire dadele h soon the neighbors do not negseem to be what they are its a conspiracy to make him crazy or to make him enter the life and role of the dead girl he fights tries to run enters the game and ends by entering the circle and slowly becoming her the circle is closedits not negthe most believable story we may have seen or heard but the strength of the film does not negreside in the story but in the details of the psychology in the slow degradation of the mental state of the hero in the permanent balancing game between reality and delusion to a certain extent it is not negwhat happens on the screen that matters but how it happens reminding the classical knife in the water made more than a decade before at the end of the polish period of polanski there are many details that are never negexplained but then this is how mystery films must be and this is actually how life is sometimes the feeling of claustrophobia slowly contaminates the viewer unfortunately some of the graphical details in the last part of the film are not negtoo well executed and the english spoken dialogs the film was made in english almost neutralize the overall atmosphere however waiting for the final punch scene is very worth the patienceits not negthe best film that polanski made yet has many good parts it shows the hand and the style of the director and was a significant step in the building of his career,1
who actually created this piece of crap this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it is such a waste of time and money i hate it how they create low budget sequels featuring dlister actors and a storyline so similar to the st onei found this movie in the bargain bin sitting right next to wild things  and death to the supermodels for  what a fool i was to actually think that this could be good instead i watched in disgust as poor acting stereotypes ripped of the storyline and script from the st onewhoever thought that this straighttovideo production was actually even a half decent film you must be on crackd or something because i think what pretty much most of the people whove seen this film thinks what a load of crap,0
one of the finest films ever made why it only got a  rating is a mystery this film is a window into the world of the black experience in america should be mandatory viewing for all white people and all children above age  i recommend watching it with the long walk home as a companion piece if you think whoopi goldbergs work is about homer and eddie or hollywood squares think again dont negmiss this movie which should have won the oscar and read the book too,0
i feel much less generous with this film than others of its ilk the portrayal of madmen in this century is always done with them being so totally bizarre as to be a different species their antics are so outrageous as to be totally fictionalized everyone is napoleon or some other historical figure or they have a fascination with chickens they are on the make or beating each other up its as if the scriptwriter said what can i make up for them to do without an sense of what insanity or even mental illness is watch the wonderful human portrayal in one flew over the cuckoos nest where the illnesses are believable and real i once worked in a state mental hospital i didnt negsee any of these guys these are too smart and calculating to make them come to life,1
dont negeven waste your time let alone pay rental for this piece of dreck how it got made is beyond me i dont negknow why theres a minimum of  lines ive already summarized this trashy movie but oh well the acting was awful like they all needed lessons the plot was weak the ending feh i think the cinematography was the only thing that didnt negtotally suck well maybe the sound was minimalistically ok the one good thing is if they could make this movie even make some money with it there may be hope for any screenwriter with a real idea so youall take heart i guess the same holds true of actors if these people actually got paid then you can too,1
if you have plenty of time to waste  its ok it moves at a good pace but to pull this movie off it would need to be a little longer with a little more background on the sitter the acting is ok mariana klaveno negas the sitter does the best job and is the most believablewilliam r moses played a pretty good part as the husbandgail ogrady as the wife had a weak part and the reasons for her going back to work were not negdevelopedthe ending is sort of silly like most of these sitter movies  there are parts that are interesting  but overall it leaves you wondering why you spent the time,1

first let me say the director has some wonderful use of titles in his establishing shots i really enjoyed them i really enjoyed this movie but i got to say next to pierce brosnan greg kinear is pretty lackluster brosnan melts into this character so well that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy that played bond it also shows his range and depth as an actor it is kinda of an indie flick and was really nice to see especially with all of the mainstream movies that flood the movies at this time of the year i found the characters to be well crafted the twist in the middle i felt was especially good i also liked how the characters come off realistically so many times we have in film these caricatures of people that are not negreally characters but walkingstereotypes i like the different approaches this movie takes i think of sideways when i think of this movie but i think this is more watchable and a better movie overall,0
before zavet there was similarity between tim burton and kusturica artistic vision they find their own poetic style and then they cowardly become prisoners of it burton has and still have depp kusturica has miki manojlovic and somehow they got critical praise for repeating same formula over and over again however there are persons like me who find joke funny only when they heard it first time thats main reason why kusturicas worst movies are black cat white cat and life is miracle zavet is something completely different you may like it you may hate it but this is not negjust another kusturica poetic  balkanic dreamlike stuff of course if you want to be praised you have to play safe it was very easy for kusturica to make just another flying gypsies movie and get award fortunately as a brave person he chooses to make movie that will be ironic look to his previous works zavet can be described as a strong and very harsh parody on previous kusturica movies directed by kusturica himself it is beautiful to see one big movie director to not negtake himself too seriously this is quality that kusturica have and even the biggest like bergman or kubrick didnt neghave this movie is so meaningless that becomes absurd so absurd that becomes deep and so unfunny that becomes hilarious same stuff that make plan  from outer space cult would made this masterpiece to people who knows how to watch it average western viewer would not negget few references most notable tire shop owner is srbljanovic  and this refers to biljana srbljanovic famous serbian dramatic writer politically she is very active as left oriented liberal and she despises kusturicas political views and anarchism kusturicas everything but not negsubtle take to her work was to castrate miki manojlovic in srbljanovic shop second reference is made to goran bregovic  previous kusturicas composer he formed funeral and wedding orchestra and start performing around europe although he is praised as big composer bregovic is just performer and most of his songs if not negall are poor covers of traditional serbian songs kusturicas take on bregovic was to confront one wedding and one funeral with funeral mocking the wedding also music is covering western classics as london bridge is falling down or french lullabies you find this unfunny now you see how we feel in serbia when listening bregovics horrible covers i really liked this movie because it is not negpretending to be deep it is so overfilled with symbols that it becomes parody and it is beautifully directed as all of his works are if you like previous kusturicas movies there is a big chance that you will hate this if you dont neglike couple of his last movies you may find this as pleasant surprise because this is like fellini directing pink flamingos on purpose i have massive respect for this guy after zavet next tim burton movie would surely have main character with pale faces next kusturica movies can easily be about aliens invading earth thats the reason why he is most interesting director on earth whether you like it or not,1

as a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are manufacturing and distributing the dvds themselves we perhaps shouldnt negexpect too much from broken in disc form and yet whats most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a james cameron dvd and a decidedly fine presentationwith regards to the latter the only major flaw is that broken comes with a nonanamorphic transfer otherwise we get the film in its original  ratio demonstrating no negtechnical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected indeed given ferraris hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a factthe same is also true of the soundtrack here we are offered both dd and dd mixes and whilst im uncertain as to which should be deemed the original the fact that ferrari had an involvement in both means neither negshould be considered as inferior indeed though the dd may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience owing to the manner in which it utilises the score both are equally fine and free of technical flawsas for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and youll notice numerous commentaries loads of featurettes and various galleries indeed given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute chunks rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary there really is little to discuss the anatomy of a stunt featurette for example is exactly what it claims to be and the same goes for the rest of pieces as such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of brokens preproduction production and postproduction and whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall making of in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to viewof the various pieces then it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion then again theres also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks the one involving the actors is overly jokey and doesnt negtake the film too seriously ferraris pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing and the technical ones are well extremely technical of course we also get some crossover with whats been covered elsewhere on the discs but at only  minutes none negof these pieces outstay their welcome indeed all in all a fine extras package,1

highly implausible unbelievable and incoherent spanish production aboutwell let me see just how close i can get to it the film opens with a woman having one of her cats killed by a young girl she then begs her lover to take her somewhere on his vacation he calls work and demands that he loses his vacation time and she says he will pay for this what relevance this plays out to is anybodys guess at the films end because the guy a swarthy photographer spies a beautiful patty shepard queen of spanish horror films it seems taking her bikini top off momentarily so he can snap a picture ask her out to lunch and then to his assignment to witches mountain  for reasons again we are never negprivy to before they go patty must stop by the house and loud eerie chanting echoes in our heros ears again this is never negexplained the film goes on with these two stopping at an inn going on to the mountain and finally realizing why the mountain is called witches mountain you know there are several aspects to this film which make it better than a bad film it has some atmosphere some of the character actors are really quite goodespecially the deaf innkeeper and the old woman the leads are at least adequate and the climax  though it makes absolutely no negsense at all  is wellchoreographedliterally with the witches in white brassieres and long black hair it just doesnt negmake any sense though and that is a huge detractor to me i could watch the film another ten times and still not negknow more now than i did after the first viewing that is a major problem the witches mountain is a curious film from the long line of cheap atmospheric european horror films that blanketed that decade if you can get more out of it than me better power to you,1

what seemed at first just another introverted french flick offering no negmore than baleful sentiment became for me on second viewing a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentationspoiler of sorts followspoor cedric he apparently didnt negknow what hit him poor audience we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch these two guys just didnt negbelong together from their first ambiguous encounter as much as mathieu and cedric were sexually attracted to each other the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for mathieu an intellectual being to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beachon a purely technical note i loved the camera action in this film subtitles were totally unnecessary even though my french is presque rien i could watch it again without the annoying english translation and enjoy it even more this was a polished very professionally made motion picture though many scenes seem superfluous i rate it nine out of ten,0

the plot of this enjoyable mgm musical is contrived and only occasionally amusing dealing with espionage and romance but the focus of the film is properly pointed upon the tuneful interludes showcasing the enormously talented and athletic tap dancing eleanor negpowell abetted by tommy dorsey and his orchestra featuring ziggy elman buddy rich and frank sinatra red skelton shares top billing with powell and he and sidekick bert lahr are given most of the comedic minutes although skelton is more effective when he if it can be believed performs as powells love interest with virginia obrien actually providing most of the films humor as the dancers companion the technical brilliance of powell is evidenced during one incredible scene within which buddy rich contributes his drumming skills and which must be viewed several times in order to permit ones breathing to catch up with her precision director edward buzzell utilizes his large cast well to move the action nicely along despite the rather disjointed script with which he must deal and permits powells cotangent impossibilities to rule the affair as is appropriate,0

when you are in a gloomy or depressed mood go watch this film it shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday setting and it is very encouraging in particular from a feminist and a humanist perspectivewhen you know both the turkish language and either the danish or the german language go watch the film in any case half of the dialog is danish in the original synchronized to german in the translated version the other half turkish subtitled in danish or german respectively when i watched it in mannheim germany the reaction of the turkishspeaking audience proved that there must be a lot of humor in the turkish dialog which deplorably mostly escaped me being only imperfectly rendered in the subtitles still the film is interesting even if you lack knowledge of the turkishesthetically the movie is playing a lot on the theme of speed and slowness on first sight there is lots of corporeal movement fast as lightning making it a quick an agitated film in particular even though this is a kung fu movie watch out for the running scenes beautifully expressing a wealth of emotions but there are quite a few very slow emotionally intense scenes too and above all the characters develop at a much slower pace than you would expect in a drama about the coming of age still there is some movement in the characters to closely watch the villain omar whose part and acting i liked very muchthe contrast of speed and stillness nicely contributes to the depiction of human rage and dignity  shown at once in the same characters at the same time,1

take one look at the cover of this movie and you know right away that you are not negabout to watch a landmark film this is cheese filmmaking in every respect but it does have its moments despite the look of utter trash that the movie gives the story is actually interesting at some points although it is undeniably pulled along mainly by the cheerleading squads shower scenes and sex scenes with numerous personalityfree boyfriends the acting is awful and the director did little more than point and shoot which is why the extensive amount of nudity was needed to keep the audiences attentionin the nutty professor a hopelessly geeky professor discovers a potion that can turn him into a cool and stylish womanizer whereas in the invisible maniac a mentally damaged professor discovers a potion that can make him invisible allowing him to spy on and kill for some reason his students boring fodder dont negexpect any kind of mental stimulation from this and prepare yourself for shrill and enormously overdone maniacal laughter which gets real annoying real quick,0
this film screened last night at austins paramount theater as part of the sxsw film festival we were graced with the presence of director mike binder and stars adam sandler and don cheadle who took audience questions after the film it is a remarkable and powerful film about what it is like to lose yourself and begin to find your way back the performances are phenomenal and the story manages to be both tragic and funny in a way that is all too rare the trailer for the film tries a little too hard to emphasize the comedic aspectsthis is a breakout role for adam sandler while he has begun to transition to more dramatic roles with punchdrunk love and spanglish this role is a significant step forward for him as a dramatic actor he deserves an oscar nomination as he continues down to transition to more dramatic roles as tom hanks did and jim carrey is also doing in this role he seemed to be trying to channel dustin hoffman in rain man although playing an autistic man is certainly very different than sandlers traumatized character both characters for different reasons are trapped in their own worlds of childlike isolation and confusiondon cheadles performance is less surprising but just as good after hotel rwanda and crash weve come to expect remarkable nuanced performances from cheadle he has the qualities of sincerity and honesty that comes through in this role but he too is also broken and struggling if not negin the such profound ways as sandlers character cheadle is struggling with difficulties in both his marriage and in his professional life as a dentist together the characters played by cheadle and sandler struggle to heal each other in the way that true friends often do in a way that reminds me of matt damon and robin williams in good will hunting they are both searching for that part of the themselves that they have lost and trying to find againreign over me is one of the best major studio films to be released this year the soundtrack which is almost another character in the plot is wonderful the filming in the streets of new york  a city that suffered a great tragedy and has also had to heal itself  is also quite beautiful the supporting roles by jada pinkett smith liv tyler saffron burrows in a very odd role donald sutherland and mike binder himself are all quite goodwriterdirector mike binder has really delivered a story that so many will be able to connect with on numerous levels this is a story about grief family healing male friendship mental health and the meaning of love reign over me does not negdisappoint the film is almost hypnotic as it draws you into the lives of its characters hollywood would have a much better reputation if it made more characterdriven charming films like reign over me,1
watching this stinker constitutes cruel and unusal punishment at the hands of sandler truly a slow and painful deathbought the dvd in the  bin at wal mart but the thought that keeps echoing in my head is how can i get my money backthe most unforgivable thing about the movie is that the boat just does not negsinkbest constructive suggestion mystery comedy theatre you know that show on the scifi channel in which some guy and his muppetmachines spoof the most unwatchable horror flicks mystery science theatre immediately spin off a comedy program and feature this flick without a good humorous spoof of this train wreck i fear that viewers may actually begin following sandler with ice picks and chainsaws,0
vivah is by no negmeans a classic however in the days of hardcore action pathbreaking special effects  complex plots none negof which bollywood has mastered yet its quite refreshing to see a simple film like vivah the story as we all know is a journey from a couples first meeting to their eventual wedding after some coy moments and testing times nothing negmore nothing negless the music isnt negquite in the same league as mpk or hahk but doesnt negjar your senses either two songs stood out for me  mujhe haq hai  do anjaane while milan abhi aadha  hamaari shaadi were hummable shahid performs sincerely  shows a lot of potential its good to see him play something else but the cool dude he normally does amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a docile smalltown girl to perfection alok nath anupam kher  seema biswas are terrific supports and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job surajs direction is simple but effective the movies prime flaw is the slow pace which might test the patience of a lot of young viewers but all in all a good clean decent family movie,1
i absolutely loved this film i was hesitant to watch it at first because i thought it would be too painful i remember how hard it was when john was shot however watching the two of us took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility i think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what might have been aidan quinn was adorable as paul and met the challenge head on i was impressed with his accent and mannerisms jared harris is also very talented and was quite believable as john my favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene  which was so poignant the film left me with both sadness and satisfaction both of which i feel are appropriate given the circumstances,1
this was a great movie with a good cast all of them hitting on all cylinders and when dianne keaton is at her best well it just doesnt negget any better than that but tom everett scott always underrated was even better he should be a star my only complaint is with one aspect of the screenplay none negof the characters ever acknowledged that the dead daughter wasnt negalways a good person and neither negwas her mother played by keaton at one point she breaks a promise she made to one character not negto reveal that he had been sleeping around one of the other commentators said the movie had a political agenda that is a baffling thing to say there was no negpolitics at all in this movie,1

this was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the night gallery show back in  the episode starred sue lyon of lolita movie fame and joseph campanella who play a baby sitter and a vampire respectively the vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster while he goes out at night for blood the baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampires appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no negreflection in the mirror has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child she realizes that the man who hired her may not negbe what she thought he was originally she bolts out the door the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over i dont negknow what purpose it was to make such an abbreviated episode that lasted just  minutes they should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same  minutes and skipped this one a total wasted effort,0

i have been a jodie foster fan ever since we were both kids from her disney years i loved her tomboy antics in films like candleshoefoxes was such a huge departure from all of thatwhere other young female actors of that era turned to sexual puerility disguised as comedy little darlings anyone jodie went for a depressing and tragic tale of teens dragged to their demise by the powerful allure of temptation and addictionthis was not negdisney this was not negporkys this was not halloweed this was a dark  powerful story of the destruction of young lives sadly its a tale that still plays out on a daily basis all over the country this film could be replayed with a current soundtrack and still be wholly relevantits not negthe best film ever made it is tired at some parts not negall the performances are particularly outstanding but jodie foster continued to show her chops as a real adult actor a trend started when she was very young in taxi driver out of  barky,1
endearing tale voted ten against all averages for my age and sex not negall that much comedy compared to a i almost wet myself movie although funny enough not nega fan of musicals at all so probably a little too much for me but they do give you time to grab a drink or soda without missing anything important maybe a fifties version of when harry met sally ahab no negnot negreally but if that is in your top ten like it is mine you will like this movie really it just leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling reminding you of what romance could and should be like something to shoot for my summary describes it best in very few words quite charming,1
this film was not negonly one of john fords own personal favorites but also numbered directors sergei m eisenstein and bertrand tavernier among its highprofile admirers ironically ive just caught up with it myself via criterions recent disc set after missing out on a couple of original language screenings of it on italian tv many years ago and again a few times on tv while in hollywood the film marked fords first of nine collaborations with henry fonda and is also a quintessential example of fords folksy americana vein a beautifully made and pictorially quite poetic piece of work the courtroom sequences and eventual revelation in its second half still pack quite a wallop apart from giving stalwart character actor donald meek a memorably meaty role as the prosecuting attorneyfonda is of course perfectly cast as a bashful inexperienced but rigorous and humanistic lawyer who was destined to become president fonda would go on to portray other fictitious politicians on film  most notably in franklin j schaffners the best man  and sidney lumets failsafe   and its surprising now to learn that he was reluctant at the time about accepting the role of lincoln since in his view that was like playing god it is interesting to note here that ford had previously tackled abraham lincoln tangentially in the prisoner of shark island  a superb but perhaps littleknown gem which has luckily just been released as a special edition dvd by the uks veritable criterion standin eurekas masters of cinema label besides i also have two more abraham lincoln films in my dvd collection which ive yet to watch and incidentally both were directed by d w griffith  the birth of a nation  and abraham lincoln   and had i not negjust received a bunch of films ive never negwatched before just now i would have gladly given them a spin based on my highlysatisfying viewing experience with young mr lincoln,1

if you have a chance of seeing this film do see it its quite shocking in parts and really makes you think about so many important issues but its not negdidactic in my opinion its a piece of art beautifully filmed fine music of many styles the typically impressive level of acting that one has come to expect from bbc drama nathalie press billed as natalie press is convincing in her role as depressed teenager exploited by a male classmate celia imrie has that beautifully reassuring quality that gives the sometimes unnerving action stability and the viewer comfort in the knowledge that someone out there is actually normal but the real star as always is timothy spall  surely one of the greatest actors of our time,0
sensitive film does lack brilliance and to some degree narrative structure but is nevertheless superbly shot and performed however the narrative structure point is debatable while it gives the impression of tying off loose ends nicely in the final scenes and connects its thoughts with what might be described by the modern viewer as a story im sceptical as to whether this feel needs a narrative structure that is definite and detectable inevitably it will be compared with somersault in that its central protagonist im not negsure thats the correct word is a young and very younglooking woman whose newly discovered sexuality both confuses and empowers her  although of course cate shortlands film tackles this aspect better but while the possibility exists for reckless viewers to dismiss this film as a clich peaches is in some ways much more ambitious than somersault perhaps thats where it doesnt negquite make it its certainly very different to monahans first feature  the interview im not negquite sure how the sex scenes between weaving and lung added to the story who knows  maybe they did they certainly rammed home the compromised and flawed nature of weavings character  although i personally think this was achieved without the need for these scenesjust saw the film againon a second viewing i can see how some would dismiss it as a telemovie dressed up as a feature but im not negsure how distinct these categories are anymore or even if we should be making that distinction in any case i do think there are enough layers in the film to distinguish it from hallmark efforts on the other hand the films structure is very formal and its content is hardly negchallengingat least in the way somersault tom white three dollars the illustrated family doctor look both ways and the human touch are the performances are all good but i did come to the realisation that the main reason i was enjoying the film was because it fit the australian genre without necessarily adding anythingand i can understand that this can be a fairly good reason for another person not to like it indeed it wasnt neguntil lung enters the room in her vietnamese dress that the film really begins to pack a punch but that leads us into another debate  should we expect that a film must challenge us all the time certainly i enjoy being challenged by a film or a book or other people but is there no negroom anymore for what is simply a nice storyi havent negdeleted my initial post on this film because im all too aware of the orwellian overtones of such an act but i would downgrade my initial rating from an  to perhaps a as for nominations for afi best film my votes go to the human touch three dollars and look both ways  and i think look both ways should win,0
by  dw griffith had been directing films for the biograph company for about a year and  working at a rate of two or three per week  was rapidly beginning to develop his skills as a filmmaker the sealed room is a very interesting  minute short a fascinating piece of gothic melodrama that even drifts slightly into the realm of early horror the simple narrative was probably inspired by edgar allen poes  short story the cask of amontillado and concerns a powerful king who conceives a deliciously sadistic form of revenge to punish his wifes infidelityset in medieval times the sealed room begins with the king arthur v johnson overseeing the construction of a windowless room from a sequestered dovecote the idea being that he and his wife marion leonard will have a completely private place to enjoy each others company he is obviously very much in love with her always showing his affection this latest act the crowning achievement of his endearment however unbeknownst to the king his wife has fallen in love with the royal minstrel henry b walthall during one romantic liaison inside the speciallybuilt room the wife and the minstrel are discovered and the heartbroken king conceives a means of getting his retribution on the ignorant couple silently he orders his workmen to seal off the only doorway with stone and mortar slowly descending into cackling insanity as each new stone is placed downdw griffith always had an eye for acute detail and the sealed room is an excellent early example of this the lavish medieval century costumes lend the film a sense of reality and the castle interior looks authentic enough to be believable at the time the director was also pioneering methods of creating suspense and i must admit that as the film progressed i became fixated on finding out what would happen to the hapless young lovers in the early minutes griffith restricts his shots to lengthy longtakes from a stationary camera as was usual at the time but soon  parallel to the progressively darker subject matter  he alters his editing tactics in a fascinating way though he may not neghave invented the technique griffith was crucial in popularising the use of crosscutting  that is alternating between different events occurring at the same time not negonly does this create a sense of continuity but it also maximises the level of suspense since we as the audience are well aware not negonly of the kings ghastly actions but also that the wife and the minstrel are oblivious to it alldespite these innovations the sealed room suffers from many of the shortcomings typical of the era the entire film takes place in just two rooms with footage captured from a total of just three positions and so it is prone to become dull and monotonous at times the acting performances are greatly exaggerated for extra effect however at least in the case of arthur v johnson his overplaying actually contributed to recognising the escalating madness of the betrayed king a moment that i thought particularly effective was when the two lovers attempted to exit the room only to find their only doorway replaced with a wall of solid stone their panicked reactions accompanied by the silent maniacal cackling of the king serve very well to create an impending sense of claustrophobia i did think however that their supply of oxygen was exhausted surprisingly quickly,0

this thought long lost flick sometimes comes available on the web so i bought me a copy well of course the acting is terrible and the story line is childish but it does have his moments i think people who searched this one also knows the backstory of it it was made by a grindhouse cinema owner for an extreme low budget but for me he surely didnt negspoiled the money on props but on the make up the make up is for that kind of flick well done the zombies are watchable and the gore is intact the only problem with that kind of movies is the quality of the pelicule its terrible luckely no neghiss on the sound but sometimes its way too dark so you have to watch clearly to see the gore in a funny way they tried to sell this one as really not negfor the squeamish a voiceover tells in the beginning of the movie to watch out for a sign and a man appearing with green flashes that tells you there is gore on the way of course that doesnt negwork made me think of cannibal girls had that annoying bell when the red stuff started to flow they had the original idea cannibal girls was made a year earlier dont neggo for the storyline go for the zombies and notice a continuity mistake when the girl and guy are making love first she takes of her bra then they make love and suddenly her underwear is back ontry to do that or am i getting a bit offlineeat it you ugly corpses,1

a really very bad movie with a very few good moments or qualitiesit starts off with pregnant linda blair who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks im not negsure she jumps through a window and wakes up and we see she is very pregnant the degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movieshe and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who i thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies on the island already are david hasselhoff and his germanspeaking virgin girlfriend you know how germans are said to love hasselhoff hes taking photographs and shes translating an esoteric german book about witches i thinkalso traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it and a real estate agent and a woman i thought was their daughter evidently she was an architect and linda blair and the boy are the older couples children i guess they all traveled to the island together but it really seemed like linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them maybe they were filmed separatelythe hotel seems neat certainly from the exteriors but it isnt negused to any great effect an old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in german sometimes which he eventually records on his sesame street tape recorderpeople start getting killed either in their dreams or sucked into hell or something some of these gore scenes are ok but not negenough to recommend the movie though the copy i watched stated it is uncut on the box cover the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut much of the scene is showing another characters reaction shots since were not negseeing anything ourselves the creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messylooking wound of a mouth rapes someone he looked particularly nasty theres a laughably and painfully bad scene in which linda blair is possessed i wish if a horror movie is going to cast her they would do something original with her role and let her leave exorcist behind her except for the yearly horror conventionsin the weird largely italian tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to this is also aka la casa  and ghosthouse  that is it is supposedly a sequel to casa   ghosthouse la   its not thats also a better movie than this one la casa  and two were the evil dead  and evil dead ii   again unrelated to witchery and la casa  and much better than those theres also a casa  la  aka house  which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake la casa series and the series house house  house ii the second story  the horror show  aka house iii and house iv  hows the horror show fit in there it doesnt negreally it claimed to be a sequel thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less or more confusion oddly the horror show is also aka horror house and la casa  is also aka horror house  does your head hurt yet,0

i confess to have quite an uneasy feeling about ghosts movies and while i sometimes enjoy the genre when it comes to horror but when it comes to comedies they really need to be crazy to be funny over her dead body seems to take afterlife a little bit too seriously and fails in my opinion from almost any aspect i can think about the story is completely unbelievable of course and did not negsucceed to convince me either in the comic or in the sentimental register the choice of the principal actresses was awful while paul rudd is at least handsome and looks like a nice guy the taste in ladies of his character seems to need serious improvement as eva longoria seems too aged sorry for him and lake bell seems too unattractive sorry again a romantic story without good enough reason for romance is due to failure from start jason biggs and lindsey sloane were actually better but they had only supporting roles the rest is uninteresting and uninspired with flat cinematography and cheap gags borrowed from unsuccessful tv comedies nothing negreally worth watching nothing negto remember,0
this really should have been a one star but there was so many clichs predictable twists seen it all before slasher flick parallels that i actually give it an extra star for the fact it made me laughalthough this was never negthe directors intention im surei dont negoften write comments about films they have to be either sensational or in this ones case really badto be honest as soon as i saw jeff fahey in it i knew it was going to be poor as he has a unique nose for picking out the worst filmssomehow the farce of it all made me watch it all the way through possibly for the hilarious voice of mr t not negrelay mr t but youll know what i mean if you bother to watch this if you do watch it make sure you dont negpay to see it this may have worked had they actually put intended comedy into it but im sure youll find the odd laugh here and there at the farce of it all,0

i just watched this horrid thing on tv needless to say it is one of those movies that you watch just to see how much worse it can get frankly i dont negknow how much lower the bar can go the characters are composed of one lame stereotype after another and the obvious attempt at creating another bad news bears is embarrassing to say the very leasti have seen some prized turkeys in my time but there is no negreason to list any of them since this is numero unolet me put it to you this way i watched the vanilla ice movie because it was so bad it was funny thisthisis not negeven that good,1
i read the negative comments before viewing this film and undeterred went ahead and started watching i admit that i had to rewind quite a few times as the film is incredibly complex involved and full of detail that is a good thing but also quite unexpected in this culture of car chases explosions gratuitous sex and general violence that substitute for plot and character development in fact what a welcome departure however i am so used to not negpaying a lot of attention to what i watch this film is chock full of character development and plot line the kind that we used to analyze when i was in high school it requires actual mental participation on the part of the viewer what a nice change i would compare it to all the presidents men in terms of generic subject matter that is it is a mystery about intense misconduct on the part of elected officials and those with enough influence upon officials to essentially own them unlike all the presidents men this film makes an effort to give a couple of the characters actual personality in this sense the movie is a character study like the negotiatior with samuel jackson and kevin spacey in that movie their characters are both city employees and the plot is extremely intense yet the plot is dependent on the ability of their characters to cooperate with each other trust each and ultimately unite together against the corrupt police department there is more gun fire in this film and the specific plot is different but generically there are many similarities i will say that city hall requires a whole lot more concentration in fact i was struck how parallel it was to past and present political scandals ive seen in my life going back to watergate the thing is the public knows that something is wrong for sure but following the details is hard to do this movie is not negeven close to being as complex as real life but it actually is realistic to life in its complexity i think that is one of the reasons that previous posters have criticized the film unrealistic expectationsif one watches this knowing what they are about to see and are up to the experience it really is excellent i watched it  times in a row the acting is superb and the directing is flawless the weakest link is john cusaks accent,1
man i loved this movie this really takes me back to when i was a kid these were the days when the teachers still showed classroom films on reeltoreal and if you were good they would rewind the movie slowly so you could watch it play backward i still remember one of the opening linestutazema was his name and he was an orphan he lived with his sister so and so in the village this is a great movie for kids and as enduring as the red balloon at the end the other indian boys in the village attach the feathers to tutazema and he becomes an eagle himself he gets to live the way he always wanted to he gets to soar the heavens,1
i dont negknow why but for some sick reason i think since ive been on the disney sequel binge i decided to just go ahead and see  dalmations the first movie that was a remake of the disney cartoon classic starring glenn close as cruella de vil it seemed like a sure hit but it was just a bomb i think the reason why these movies dont negwork is because  dalmations the original was a cartoon it just worked better and was more appealing to the kids as well as adults this was not negreally that fun because its adults running around trying to act like cartoons instead of just actual human beings i understand theyre trying to make sure that its appealing to the kids but its ridicules to see the way these actors are behaving in the film and  dalmationss story isnt negreally that goodcruella de vil has been in prison for a while but things change when she is proved that she now loves animals and is a pleasant human being but her reputation is now damaged as a puppynapper but she buys a mans dog shelter and is all of a sudden is being loved by everyone and it looks like shes changed but when she sees her probation officers dalmatians she goes crazy and starts seeing spots and she looses it shes back for revenge on puppies and is still determined to get that dalmation coat shes always wantedglenn close is such an amazing actress very under rated but her taking on cruella de vil shes good but lets face it this movie made the fun villain just more of a silly nut case also as cute as the puppies were it just works more for the animation it sounds stupid but its just not negas believable without the cartoon and their personalities being in the mix i wouldnt negreally recommend  dalmations its alright but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time this is just the same thing,0
perhaps disney was hoping for another mary poppins but this is a very different story and while angela is delightful she was a very different performer to the great julie andrews having said that lansbury is perfectly cast and delivers a magical performance there is something deliciously dotty about her character and she is given wonderful support by david tomlinson tomilinson can carry a tune but he is certainly not negmuch chop as a singer it does not negmatter he was such a gifted actor you hardly negnotice there are some great cameos from much loved stars of another time like roddy mcdowel who gives a winning performance and the much loved tessie oshea who does very little but its nice to see the old gal again its also lovely to see sam jaffe and the king of english television bruce forsythe in small roles the score has a couple of beautiful songs especially the briny sea and the age of not negbelieving the big number portabello road is stretched to the limit but it has plenty of theatricality the effects look a bit clich today but the scene with the german invaders being attacked by the wildest army in film is pretty impressive the kids are not negas annoying as other movies but one does struggle to understand what the youngest boy is saying i loved the marching song of the home army the home guard were very important to britain and this is a warm tribute the animation is delightful much better than pixar which i find grotesque a warm happy film and its a wonder its not negdone on stage,1
this movie had a imdb rating of  so i expected much more from it it starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous but before the movie is halfway through it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable the characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie but we get to know them a little too well they become caricatures not negreal people at all this is the same story ive seen hundreds of times only told here with slightly different circumstances the thing is i could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog werent negso stalethe only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations and unfortunately that was also the case with dead letter office hopefully this movie will end up in the dead movie office soon,1
before the devil knows youre dead starts off promisingly setting up a simple heist that goes awry told from varying perspectives in rashomon style at around the hour mark sidney lumet transforms this film into something that is so much more than the sum of its parts it eventually morphs into a multifaceted family drama exploring the full realm of human emotionsrelations as the story comes to its chilling climaxas is the case with lumet he manages to coax exceptional performances out of his starstudded cast without any notion of overacting or hyperbole philip seymour hoffman in one of his best roles is a complex mysterious and interesting character and oftentimes dwarfs ethan hawke who plays his brother hank thats not negto say that hawke is not negbad in fact he is quite above adequate in a troubled role that suits his style marisa tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance the fact that she bares her flesh adds to this albert finneys character andy and hanks father is the most intriguing and in my opinion he deserved a bit more screentime amy ryan also performs her job adequatelybefore the devil knows youre dead is not negan exceptional movie but it proves that lumet is still near the top of his game at the apparent twilight of an illustrious career many of his characteristics and trademarks appear here not negleast of which involves the use of his characters infused with a killer script no negpun intended smart dialogue and pacing and a decent score before the devil knows youre dead is a mustsee a truly underrated gem   stars out of  should just enter my top  at  highly recommended,1
ghost of dragstrip hollow was one of the many s movies about hotrodding teens encountering the supernatural in this case the teens cant negpay the rent for their hangout and get evicted with nowhere negelse to go they decide on an apparently haunted house as you may have guessed once they arrive some weird things start happening and theres a twist at the endtheres nothing negin this movie that you havent negseen in other movies but its nice entertainment nonetheless my favorite character was the foulmouthed parrot well let me rephrase that he didnt negtalk like a character in a quentin tarantino negmovie but he said things that we dont negexpect out of a bird the movies pure hokum but harmless,1
this movie is incredibly realistic and i feel does a great justice to the crime that many people do not negunderstand because of a lack of experience the many people who think they could fathom what goes through a victims mind are arrogant as a victim i feel that dawson did a fantastic job in her role of maya i agree that this is an incredibly brave film this looks at rape from a different more realistic standpoint than any other movie ive ever seen on the subject the end did drag on a bit long but i know that many victims imagine this kind of justice since the chances of an attacker being sent to jail for their crime is around  its good to see a movie that sticks closer to reality than most would dare to,0
when i found the movie in the schedule for christmas its title did not negsound familiar to me since i have not negread the novel and had not negheard anything about the film yet having read the content i decided to spend my christmas evening on watching the movie the effect surprised me totally i do not negremember when i last saw a film in which every single moment involved me a vow to cherish is without any doubt one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise i have received from cinema here are some arguments of mine why i consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema first the entire content is particularly educational it has something to offer to the modern audience  pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions is there a need for christ in our times does love still matter what for is there faith what is the logics of burden and suffering in life is there really someone by my side i can always trust the movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of ussecond the movie is exceptionally humane the main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions is it better for kyle david denman and teri megan paul to start their own lives and forget about the family or retain the values they were taught at home is it better for john ken howard to leave ellen barbara babcock his sick wife and start a new happy life with julia donna bullock a woman he falls in love with in fact ellen no neglonger recognizes him yet he decides to vow his wife eternal fidelity had johns rebellious brother phil d david morin better go on his easy life although it does not negbring him satisfaction or once start to think seriously of his life phils prayer to god in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity these words could be as well said by everybody no negmatter of where when or how they livethird the movie is a great portrayal of family not negvery popular nowadays there are problems yet there is always something more powerful that gets these people together this something is love and trust i know that it may seem a bit idealistic not negall families can rely on fidelity and it may not negbe as simple as that nevertheless it is a very educational aspect and a realistic onefourth the entire film focuses on peoples mutual help if we want to live happy lives in our society we must understand one thing we have to help one another alexander ossie davis is an example of such attitude at the beginning of the movie we see him talk to john about praying later he helps his brother alexander is a kinda angel that is sent to john and his family isnt negit possible that we may become angels to one anotherfifth the artistic features are also worth attention performances barbara babcock gives an authentic performance as ellen and although she has a difficult role she does a perfect job consider for instance the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again ken howard is also memorable as the faithful husband picture the most memorable for me was the scene of john and ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves autumn while the sunshine love spreads everywhere i interpreted as a sort of symbol even if there is sorrow this can always be illuminated by light and joya vow to cherish is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe at the end i would like to quote the profound words from the movie i found very touching and hope you will also do kyle to his uncle phil yes he john brighton lives according to the bible but nobody negforces you to do so yet according to what rules do you live,1
four tales of terror regarding the events at a creepy old mansion are recounted to sceptical scotland yard investigator holloway john bennett as he investigates the whereabouts of the latest occupant of the house that dripped bloodone can only struggle to find the words to describe the true brilliance that is the house that dripped blood this seventies horror anthology is quite remarkable in the way that such a visually innocent movie is capable of inducing horror in even the most discerning of viewers incredibly the number of depictions of violence onscreen can be counted on one hand but the film is still able to portray brutality and succeeds in conjuring up the most horrific images in the viewers own imagination all the while refraining from taking the obvious route of graphic violence in a rare feature of early seventies horror the technicalities of the movie are virtually flawless from the faultless performances of the starstudded cast featuring the legendary peter cushing christopher lee and ingrid pitt all the way to the superb direction and story telling courtesy of peter duffell and master of the macabre writer robert bloch the author of the novel psycho the only real complaints that one may have with the house that dripped blood are the somewhat asinine plottwists at the end of the first two segments and the predictable ending of the picture but even these minor negdetails fail to detract from the overall viewing enjoymentthe first segment entitled method for murder tells the story of charles hillyer denholm elliott a horror author who rents the creepy house while he works on his latest novel while working on the novel hillyer continues to start seeing the murderous character from his story in and around the house and soon begins to question the difference between fiction and reality elliotts performance in this piece is truly exceptional and his character is given a surprising air of believability the key to this segment as with the others is the mystery surrounding the events that take place the viewer is made to question whether the sight of the murderous character of dominic is merely a hallucination a schizophrenic disorder or whether the character is actually there duffells direction succeeds in creating an unsettling atmosphere coupled with a slow methodical approach to engendering the tension and suspense required to make the segment greatly enthrallingthe following segment features peter cushing as the new occupant of the sinister house during a trip into town he comes across a wax museum of horrors and decides to venture in while there he discovers a wax model of a beautiful woman that seems all too familiar to him cushings character philip is then joined by his friend neville joss ackland who also wishes to visit the museum much to the dismay of philip in this segment the viewer is given no negmore than very subtle clues as to the mystery of the wax woman but in general the viewer is left in the dark there is far less tension to this particular story yet the segment still succeeds in maintaining its air of mystery through a particularly harrowing dream sequence and the general ambiguity of the story duffells direction is once again exceptional and while this is quite possibly the weakest of the four stories there is no negdenying that through some creative direction and credible acting waxworks is still a delightful entry into the filmwaxworks is followed by what is in my opinion the greatest of the four segments  sweets to the sweet christopher lee stars as john reid the father to a young girl who to begin with has an inexplicable fear of fire which is soon remedied by caring nanny ann norton nyree dawn porter however john appears to be harbouring a dark secret about the family sweets to the sweet is easily the most sober and intricate of the four stories and that is why the segment is undeniably compelling to the viewer throughout the segment small and subtle clues are released about the truth behind the family but it is not neguntil the immensely horrific final scene that everything slots neatly into place this is the best example of how duffell used dramatic tension and suspense to create the foreboding atmosphere that made the entire film great accompanied by a wonderfully arranged soundtrack sweets to the sweet is an exercise in sustained fear that grabs the viewer by the throat and refuses to let go until the agonising screams that end this piece finally cease personally i believe that this short segment would have made an entertaining and haunting feature length movie and i would give this segment a rare the film is ended with the story surrounding the missing performer that the investigator was originally interested in jon pertwee and ingrid pitt star as two performers who are currently working on a horror movie pertwees character is disgusted with the amateurish production and props of the film and so he purchases his own vampire cloak from a strange shop of mysteries however strange things begin to happen when he wears the cloak and soon he begins to fear the worst this segment which places the inspector amongst the events is a nice way to wrap up a wonderful anthology although there is an irrefutable air of camp to the segment this is in a way what makes the story so enjoyable unfortunately there is little in this segment that could be classed as frightening in any sense and the predictable ending could have been executed better but nonetheless the segment has its redeeming features horror buffs should definitely look out for pertwees brief comment on bela lugosis and christopher lees portrayal of dracula this slightly comical and lighthearted approach to the final segment is in essence an adequate and almost natural way of ending the picture even if it lets down the film when compared to the earlier examples of suspensedriven horrorto sum up the house that dripped blood is one of the greatest horror anthologies that features an incredible cast great stories and above par direction there are certainly worse ways to spend one hundred minutes of your life and while blood and guts fans will be highly disappointed fans of more tense horror efforts should enjoy this film immensely my rating for the house that dripped blood,0
this movie which was released directly on video should carry a warning label that it is dangerous to human health and may subject the viewer to terminal boredom it is yet another thinly veiled evangalizing rapture religious movie with the good guys the believers suddenly vanishing and the bad guys the nonbelieversleft behind its an interesting concept especially since we see it happen on a flight captained by a nonbeliever who is having a sinful affair with a stewardess aboard needless to say that sinner doesnt negdisappear either unhappily with all the pilots being nonbelievers the plane did not negcrash or the movie would have been mercifully over though this could have be interesting without the heavy religious browbeating as a whole the plodding movie makes one gag the acting is horrible and the obviously computergenerated simulations are very fake looking plus its yet another movie shot in canada that purports to be new york city spare meill just read the bible,1
the film concerns a classic theme in fact it concerns the theme exploited by batman from beginning to end but in real data and details the mayor of new york appreciated and very diligent and dynamic in order to get some project through slightly faster than normal yields to some pressure from some private business contractors about a criminal drug dealer who should have been sent and kept in prison and he pressurizes the judge in his turn to set him free on probation in spite of a negative probation report that disappears but is not negdestroyed be it only because of the political value it represents and what was to happen happens and a few people including a black schoolboy is killed in a shoot out between a police detective and that criminal the city may explode because of it racial tension because of the black school boy and social tension because of the insecurity such criminals free to roam around and go on with their criminal activities represent to the public unluckily the film does not negshow that tension very well and follows the investigation of the first deputy mayor who wants to find out the truth and does find it out but along the way a few witnesses are killed and those who had played some role in the whole business are forced to retire the judge to end their career and life the contractor or the contractors go between a public officer who was ready to deliver the disappeared probation report and some shady character after he provides some crucial information the mayor himself retires and takes a long vacation but the main interest of the film is in the exploration of the contortions the mayor is doing to cover up the problem and the contortions he remembers having done in the past that led to the mistake about this probation case the political philosophy that nothing negis pure white or pure black and that everything is grey which is never negcomfortable to decision makers is invoked as an excuse for wrong but profitable decisions we are not negspeaking of necessary compromises to get to some consensus in some domains that are crucial to public interest we are speaking of considering as less important to take a bad decision about some petty or supposedly petty criminal than some infrastructure or economic project in the city that is not negtypical of new york that is true in any mayoral office it is just more significant in quantity and in quality in a big metropolitan area like new york and of course in a city or country where police departments are municipal and are controlled by political imperatives the young deputy mayor is thus pushing the old mayor out of the way and he derails his ambition to be the governor negof new york in order to become the president of the us the mayor is perfect due to the embodiment al pacino negoffers us since he is able to express ten minutes of dialogue with one facial expression that makes the whole dialogue useless i find the end slightly mushy with the exdeputy mayor campaigning in his own name that seems to mean that he was so attached to justice because he saw his chance to push the mayor out of his own way hence he is not negbetter than all the others just still too young in his ambitiondr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris  pantheon sorbonne  university versailles saint quentin en yvelines,0

forget the campy religious movies that have monopolized the televisionfilm market this movie has a real feel to it while it may be deemed as a movie that has cheap emotional draws it also has that message of forgiveness and overall good morals however i did not neglike the lighting in this movie for a movie dealing with such subject matter it was too bright i felt it took away from the overall appeal of the movie which is almost an unforgivable sin but the recognizable cast and their performances counteract this oversightdefinitely worth seeing buy the dvd,1

let me start by saying that i totally agree with the basic thesis of the film that there probably was no neghistorical jesus and christianity is a sham with that said this movie does a pretty poor job of proving that thesis it makes good argumentsthe gap between jesus theoretical life and the writing of the gospels filled only by the writings of paul who doesnt negindicate a historical jesusand then utterly fails to convincingly argue them it makes broad statements without presenting the evidence the statements are based on and it resolutely ignores counterarguments presented by christian apologists the intellectual dishonesty emotional manipulation and lack of serious argument are obvious and stunning the only christians we hear from in the film are the head of the filmmakers old schoolwho comes off like a reasonable rational person attempting to deal with a twit with a chip on his shoulderand various christians encountered apparently at random in a parking lot im sorry but revealing that average christians dont negknow much about their religion isnt negexactly damning evidence of christianitys fraudulence you may as well claim that jay leno neghas disproved the existence of michael dukakis on his jaywalking segment the interviews with experts can be interesting but the film is filled with too much of lets be honest the filmmaker just being snarky within the first five minutes the film has already conflated jerry falwell with charles manson and the writers of the left behind series with the branch davidians and by the end the film becomes so selfcentered that theres no negrational argument left just an angry former christian lashing out at the people and places he blames for his messed up childhood yknow maybe that movie couldve been interesting but its misplaced in a documentary about the historicity of jesus and its so selfcongratulatory as to deflate any sympathy this is a michael moore film without the humor or the filmmaking acumen combined with a richard dawkins book without the wit or the intellectual rigor skip it,0

in the title i write that the story is ludicrous below ill elaborate and tell you why it in my humble opinion ruins this moviegere and danes are doing their jobs and while its not negtheir best work its quite ok the rest of the cast though is doing a really poor job mind you this is not negentirely the actors fault the problem is that gere and danes are the only ones that have characters that have even the slightest room in the movie to really give any depth all other characters have either too little room in the movie to create any depth or the character is such a clich that it doesnt negmatter how hard the actors trythe director has a bit of a seen complex but looking merely at the direction i think he does an ok jobbut the story this is the kind of script that is bad in two ways first of all its a bad movie script the characters are shallow except for geres and danes characters the villains are clichs and the actions of the characters is totally unbelievable besides this the writers must have an agenda where they want to bring back our views and ethics a hundred years its the kind of movie that are saying that some criminals are still criminals regardless of the fact that they have paid the price the society has given them its also the kind of movie that says albeit only between the lines that every form of sexual deviance should be punished without trial judge or jury and of course according to the movie everything that is not negsex in the missionary position by a married couple is a sexual devianceso if youre going to film school and need an example of a bad script or if youre writing scripts yourself and want an ego boost see it for everyone else i recommend another movie,0

extremities is the disturbing yet riveting screen version of a play by william mastriosimone who adapted his own play for the screen about a woman who is attacked in her car one night by a wouldbe rapist on her way home and is terrified when she realizes the man got her purse and knows where she lives after her roommates leave for work the next day the guy shows up at her home and attempts to rape her the story takes a surprising twist when at one point the woman turns the tables on the man and is able to overpower him but when she realizes there is no negway that attempted rape can be proved and if the man is arrested he will just get off she decides to keep him prisoner in the house until she can get a confession out of him farfetched maybe disturbing definitely but theres a wonderfully claustrophobic feel about this film especially the middle with just the woman and her attacker that you cant neghelp but feel completely a part of whats going on i did not negsee the play on broadway but i would imagine a piece like this works better onstage but that doesnt negmake this film any less riveting an experience farrah fawcett one of the last actresses to do the role on broadway was awarded the role of marjorie in the film version and delivers a taut and deeply moving performance as the victim who refuses to be a victim many critics found fawcetts performance to be onenote but for me marjorie is a woman completely numbed by what she has been through and the performance works for me james russo in the performance of his career is slimy and menacing as the wouldbe rapist who finds marjorie to be much more of a challenge than he assumed alfre woodard and diana scarwid costar as marjories roommates who come home after marjorie has overpowered the guy and has him tied up and stuffed in their fireplace upon their arrival and its the arrival of the roommates that take the story to an unexpected level because they didnt negsee what we saw marjorie go through and therefore think she should call the police and let them handle the guy not negfor the faint of heart but if you can stand it a gripping film experience anchored by a lead performance that will surprise you,0

this was no negtrainspotting or guy ritchie film it was a big wannabee it wanted to be an edgy nervouslaughter urbanlife affirming film but its more of a camera jerky mess its a lot easier to imitate something else than to create a real story with real characters from the beginning i couldnt negcare less about the characters or what they were involved in they were always always hitting pissing or crying on each other only there wasnt negany substance to what they were doing the dialog between characters is meant to be hip revealing instead it comes out trite and one scene after another is predictable i know there are viewers out there that really liked this movie so i could be wrong,0
atlantis was much better than i had anticipated in some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age although this film did demand a soid attention span at times it was a great film for all ages i noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure i think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies a lot of these kids have seen nothing negbut parodies after a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching atlantis,0
tell the truth im a bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people which is also the main reason why i actually decide to see this movie and after having seen it i was really a disappointed and this comes from the guy that loves this genre of movieim surprise at this movie all completely  it is like a kids movie with nudity for absolutely no negreason and it all involve little children cursing and swearing im not negat all righteous but this has really gone too far in my accountsynopsis the story about two guys got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior there they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freakjust the name it self is not negreally connected with the story at all they are not negbeing a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done the story is very predictable though expected and the humor is lame and havent we already seen the same characters play by mc lovin in so many other movies like sasquatch gang i think i laugh thrice and almost fell a sleepwell the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay and the acting is soso as expected when youre watching this type of movie and the direction what do one expect this is the same guy who brought us wet hot american summer and that movie also sucks but somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous movieanyway i felt not negtotal riff off but a completely waste of time only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie cant really see any point why i should recommend this to anyonepros elizabeth bank two topless scenescons not negfunny dreadful story nudity and kids do not negmix togetherrating  grade f,1

teresa pavlinek was a popular member of the toronto second city cast she has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in canada finally someone has the sense to create a show for her the supporting case seems quite good too i have now watched the pilot several times and i still find it refreshing though i am not negsure why the show is listed as the jane show  i might be wrong but as far as i am aware the show was conceptualized in  and appeared on global tv in canada in early  it is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well too bad this couldnt negbe paired up with corner gas now i know corner gas is on ctv but the two shows would be great companion pieces,1
the most moving and truly eye opening documentary ever created i cried the whole way through from start to end watching the show you are immediately captured by a mans struggle to live without pain to live a life we would take for granted the first time i heard the title i was almost scared to see the program it was hard for me to comprehend living in agony every day of every year of my life i truly felt for him the saddest part of the documentary is when jonny picks out his coffin could you imagine doing that even more so even though he was in excruciating and unbearable pain he still opened up his own charity debrajonny is one of the only people that deserves true respect and admiration he is the definition of a role model what a true and undeniable hero he was,1
wonderful film one of the best horror films of the s she is realistic settings and atmospheres as usual it was inevitable the usual negative comments i have noticed that most horror films of a certain period many times fail to reach even sufficiency obviously because most horror movies are old and must be denigrati is like a mental mechanism that moves the minds of the potential of music critics herebefore you read the review already knew what was the final judgment in the film a good gift because  is really well done raines reads quite well and the film as a way in which it was produced reminds me a lot of kubrick films he really impression excellent film really i consider a film anthology of years,0
i just want to make one thing clear i love michael vartan but this film really lets him down his acting is still superb hes still as charming as ever and he still looks great but the film itself is a load of rubbish natasha henstridge im sorry to say it comes over bit manly youre constantly waiting for her to run off with her best friend whos own substoryline is a little weird myself and my family who sat down and watched the film with me were also put off by the soundtrack to the film at times the music just didnt negfit with what was going on in the scenes however even this was not negthe worst aspect of what i found to be a very disappointing film i could forgive the leading ladys butchness i could forgive the freakish characters that were thrown in to the mix and i could forgive the poor choice of musical accompaniment but whose choice was it to cut out the whole middle section of the film and skip straight to the end the ending was obviously planned from the beginning but how it gets there is left untold if youre a michael vartan fan skip this film buy yourself a poster instead,0
i really loved this version of emma the best kate beckinsale was awesome as emma and mark strong was very good as knightly the only complaint that i had was on mr woodhousei cant negbelieve that a man could whine so much or be so selfish with his daughters lifeshe was a smart girl in the end though as always i love the places in which these jane austin movies were shot the settings are so spectular it makes me want to visit england so much as well as ireland and scotland i think the actors chosen for this movie were a good choice as well and all the other story lines interwhined with emmas most excellently i am glad that i got to see this one as well,1
the london underground has something inherently creepy about it with its long winding tunnels the escalators taking you deeper and deeper underground and of course the rats roaming the tracksit a source of wonder that it is not negused in horror films more often it was used in the seventies horror deathline aka raw meat featuring a cannibalistic tribe living in a disused tunnel and the celebrated chase sequence in american werewolf in london so i was pleased to see that someone else had tried to capitalise on the atmosphere of the tube at night with the recent uk production creepi thought the film started off well with a highly effective credit sequence that was genuinely unnerving followed by a scene in the sewers that sets up the premise of there being something evil lurking below the streets of london however creep went downhill from here and i found myself wishing that id switched it off after this opening scene leaving me with a favourable impression of the film all the characters become unsympathetic and unlikable even potente herself and the director felt the need to hit us over the head with social commentary about homelessness he also made the mistake of showing the monster in full lighting where he ceases to become remotely scary and reveals his name to be craig how can you have a monster called craig it turns into an x filestype thing and reminds one of the episode tombs in fact i was wishing mulder and scully would turn up and sort them all out for meas for the infamous sexualised violence it is very graphic disturbing and totally unnecessary it seems to be there merely to shock the audience rather than for any intrinsic plot value the trouble is it is so over the top and horrific that it actually numbs you to the rest of the horror which is a mistake as its only halfway through the filmso there you go the only redeeming feature of the film for me was a rare appearance from ken campbell one of my favourite occasional actors you dont negsee him very often but when hes on screen he acts everyone else into a corner casting him as a sewer inspector was a stroke of genius unfortunately the only one evident in the film,1

normally im not negmotivated to write reviews but this movie was so excruciatingly painful i feel i must i cringed at the appallingly predictable plot the lame acting and laughed at moments which were supposed to be tense indeed most of the audience seemed pretty bored and chatty even at the most tense moment of the movie molly ringwald stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production even the twist at the end wasnt ive heard it said that the movie didnt negtake itself seriously but i could find little evidence of that in the moviecut should have been left on the cutting room floor do yourself a favour and spend your time and money on something else,0

this film once sensational for its forwardthinking politics and depictions of free love and sexual liberation has been reduced by time to a mere curiosity it seems absurd now that this mostly boring little film had been banned and seized by governments in many countries given how socialistic sweden eventually became the radicalism of its politics once controversial appear naive and almost mainstream four decades later and its sex scenes at one time the subject of sensational obscenity trials look pretty tame in a modern context nevertheless the film and accompanying documentaries detailing its many controversies and influences remains marginally watchable as an early reliquary of s youth rebellion one part of the film that still holds up its selfconsciousness with respect to the fourth wall every once in a while the filmmakers film themselves making the film the satiric playfulness of this still elicits a chuckle,0
radiofreccia is a movie about all of us about our dreams our friends our obsessions our addictions our fears it is a brilliant movie where a group of friends like all of us have lives through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades in the last century the movie doesnt negtake a happy or sad approach on things it just tells us a story one that all of us could have experienced one of happiness and excitement sadness and grief the power of this story is in that we grow to love the characters it is one of those movies you will watch over and over again feeling closer to the little town in emilia romagna where it takes place hoping one day to be able to finally walk its streets next to freccia and his friends listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio playing radio raptus international playing their dreams our dreams radiofreccia will make you laugh it will make you cry at times it will shock you and comfort you it will give you and take from you personally i believe it to have played an important part in my life and that of my friends and i suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours,0
saw this late one night on cable at the time i didnt negknow that the girl billed as shannon wilsey was actually porn star savannah but she was so beautiful and got naked so often thank god that i actually sat through this brainrotting drivel i like cheesy flicks as much as the next guymore than the next guy actuallybut this was way beyond cheesy and more into rancid the truly annoying overacting by the mad scientist and the directors writers and special effects peoples virtually total incompetence detracts from the gratuitous nudity that is the movies only saving grace savannah before she turned into the plasticized barbie doll she became as a porn queen is really interesting to watchshes dropdead gorgeous bursts into uncontrollable giggling at times glances offcamera and laughs and just generally seems to be having a really good time which is more than can be said for the audience for even though savannah and her colleagues spend a fair amount of this picture naked it still cant neghide the fact that this is an incredibly stupid badly made and annoying movie if you know someone who has it on video or if it comes on cable some night check it out but dont negwaste your money on a rental,0
big spoilers ive seen one other takashi miike film and that was the very disturbing and brutal audition which was an examination of the japanese ideals of femininity in visitor q which i think means visitor question he examines in a very disturbingly gross way the family unit miikes surreal vision of a dysfunctional family almost tries to be lynchian in terms of confusion and filmmaking but ultimately lacks the style and intrigue we the audience are introduced to a bizarre array of scenarios from the opening scene with the father figure kenichi endo who was actually quite good paying for sex with his displaced daughter fujiko then as the father returns home he is struck on the head by the visitor kazushi watanabe wielding a fairly sizeable rock and for some reason they both end up back at the family home the mother shungiku uchida is beaten and bullied by her son jun muto who is also beaten and bullied by his school peers when the visitor enters the home he somewhat menacingly establishes himself as part of the unit eventually the family begin to improve their relationship with assistance from the visitor through milking breasts murder and retaining a sense of family prideand there are other crazy scenes that somehow bring the family closer together its has uncomfortable humour but is equally frustratingly silly and overthetop in its weirdness there is a necrophiliac scene that is utterly disgusting but ends up being ridiculously funny as the scene progresses partly because of the situation itself and partly because you cant negbelieve the filmmakers and the actors are actually doing this the style of the film is poor to say the least and the plot is stupid and unbelievably weak the characters themselves are all over the place and while i understand this is not negmeant to be realistic there is hardly negany interest in these confronting characters and situations as all of them border on the absurd the camerawork is sloppy and doesnt neghave that cinematic feel that lynchs work entails its hard to take this film seriously on a surrealist level or on an interpretation of examining the family unit in japan it just seems that miike was out to shock and the film seems selfaware that its trying to be shocking and it becomes almost comical to be taken seriously all in all i would say that this film is a bizarrely dark comedy but it looks and feels amateurish and seems to unnecessarily want to shock miikes previous film audition was finely balanced between disgusting horror character development and technique which established more intrigue in the way the film was crafted to allow the viewer to become engrossed with the plot visitor q is a step down as it tries too hard to be outlandishly bizarre and intentionally confronting without really having much to say in the process  out of,1

this is so incredibly bad poor actors you can tell theyre trying really hard to polish a turd but we all know you cant the writing is so obvious and facile its sad watching them try to sell it the humor and pacing are so labored its hard to believe any of these good actors signed on for thisthat said its so awful that were having a hard time looking away from the screen we just have to know where this trainwreck goes but thats only because we caught it on tv if we had actually paid for this wed be disgusted so it gets  stars for being at least amusinglyfascinatingly bad and the incidental music as opposed to the tryingtoohard indie soundtrack is laughably reminiscent of an episode of scoobydoo but not negas good,1
its always nice to see angela bassett getting to do a role that she can really sink her teeth into she is at times intense funny and even sexy in her role as lena a colored woman forced to make a home on a desolate mudbank just outside of cape town south africa danny glover is also good in a not negentirely sympathetic role as her partner boesman willie jonah gives a finely nuanced performance as the stranger that discovers boesman and lenas new living area its not negoften that you get a chance to see an intelligent film dealing with mature themes although it is based on a play the late director john berry who also directed claudine opens the material up by having the film shot in the widescreen cinemascope format he also keeps things visually interesting through the creative blocking of actors and by showing us things only mentioned in the play just like diahann carroll in claudine john berry may have directed angela bassett into an academy award nomination this is definitely a film worth searching for,0

although it has been  years i still remember the complete waste that comprises the entire plot of the movie unfortunately i came across this movie after my friends and i selected it while browsing through the new releases at blockbuster we decided to pick the movie because it was the only one we all had not negseen and it sounded like it may be enjoyable although it has been quite some time since i viewed the movie i still remember the lack of plot seriously there is no negtrue plot and complete waste of time that was spent watching the movie if you are in the video store and this film catches your eye walk on and find a better movie if you did end up seeing this movie i understand your pain,0
i saw the description of the movie on tcm and only let it run because i like both peter ustinov and maggie smith so i was delightfully surprised to find that i really liked the movie and found it quite exceptional of course it is seriously dated but as a period piece it is well worth watching just for the subtle humour in insight into life and lifestyle almost forty years ago now the only problem is trying to find it on dvd so i can watch it more often i also was quite taken with the performances of smith and ustinov as the leads and of karl malden bob newhart and the cameo appearances by robert morley and cesar romero,0

years have past since alex rain played by olivier gruner in the first movie stumbled onto the horrific plot that involved replacing humans with machines however since then a war between cyborgs and humans has emerged and we lost now a superwoman of sorts who is the daughter of olivier gruners character she also inherits only half of his minimal acting ability which i think is the films minimal connection to the first however when the superwoman is created she hides in  while a bounty hunter from the future hunts her down in this confusing scifi clunker nemesis became a cult hit that i can see why people liked even though i was no negfan of said film nemesis tried very ambitiously to come up with different ideas develop a beautiful look and provide tons of action it almost worked nemesis  doesnt negeven have that ambition its a cheap rip off of the terminator with a muscled female who is so low on acting ability she makes olivier gruner seem like a master thespian and the action sequences lack the explosive scope that was the main selling point of the original ill admit i was no negfan of the original but it deserved a better follow up than this the original also featured a good cast like tim thomerson cary hiroyuki tagawa thom mathews brion james thomas jane and yes jackie earle haley this one features nobody negand this time its just a dull movie with a pretentious vibe in fact after i saw this it inspired to add a half star to the original out of bad,0
my expectations were quite high for this film everyone i know who saw this film at the cinema told me that everyone there stayed through the credits because they were so touched my expectations could not neghave been any higher anything short of wonderful would have disappointed mei was anything but disappointed by this movie i loved how it dealt with difficult subjects without going through the usual steps a hollywood film tends to include in this film characters worked through problems they had had for decades they worked through prejudicm they learned to open up but it did not negcome easily and not negjust by singing a song or two it was painful it took arguments it took confrontations it felt like real lifeone scene that really stuck out to me was the scene in which gabriella sings her song helen sjholm is one of my favorite singers her voice is lovely and you could tell that she was not negjust lipsyncing to a previous recording during filming which i often find in other movies she really sang with her whole body and soul you could feel what gabriella was feeling in that scene had this movie been made in hollywood her song would most likely have been sung toward the end and it would have made her husband open his eyes and see the error of his ways as well as making the other people in the village realise a thing or two instead it came halfway through and it did not negbring any solutions her husband did not negbecome overwhelmed and realise what hes putting her through and it didnt negseem to make anyone else in the village more open minded it was beautiful it was pure and it was touching but it did not negmagically solve all her problems that felt real to me thats probably what would have happened in real life the whole movie felt like real life to me nothing negneatly wrapped up but everything with a sense of joy and happiness you rarely find a movie which feels so realisticthere were a few things that bothered me but hey no negmovie is perfect if you havent negalready you should go see as it is in heaven and be filled with a joy for life a sense of hope and the feeling that youve been touched on a level movies rarely reach you will be sad pained happy and a dozen other emotionssomeone once said that if every person in the world sang in a choir there would be no negmore wars having seen this film i might have to agree,0

when i first started watching these it became one of my favourite shows melissa joan hart is very funny and talented so were the aunts and the other characters and the star of of the show salem the cat he was immensely funny the first few season in my opinion were the best where sabrina was a teenager in high school adapting to witch life they were most funniest most entertaining and most um good im not nega fan of when they started introducing brad and dreamer cause i quite liked valerie but they were okay the problem was they were only in it for one season if youre gonna have new people at least keep them i didnt neglike josh he was a twt i preferred harvey but then he disappeared and they got rid of libby it would have been awesome if thy had been bickering in theses seven years and mr craft as well if him and zelda got married that would have been gold then sabrina moves out of her aunts house and into roxiemilesmorgans house i didnt neglike theses people either it didnt negreally seem they liked sabrina sabrina seemed to lose her charm and stuff and the aunts seem to be shunned out of her life and into theyre own stupid story lines i kind of stopped watching it for a while and the old reruns were back and i was like whoohoo lol i must say the last few seasons were absolutely terriblethey got rid of the aunts which sucked cause they were a big part of the show then suddenly she lets those two freeloaders move in to the nice house when they treated he like dirt and now shes working at some magazine shop so theyre putting loads celebrity guest stars into the show if theyre in every episode it kind of ruins it the programme just really went downhill and lost its luster i saw the last episode it had the aunts in it zelda was reduced to a candle and shes about to get married but she runs off with harvey the end i would have liked to know what happened after well thats my review and the only thing i can say is the only thing that stayed its appealing self through the seven years was salem the cat,1
i saw this film on its release and have watched it  or  more times including last week i regret i have to be a voice of dissension with regard to mr branaghs performancethis is really a glorious sumptuous film to say nothing negof ambitious at over  hours long  beautifully shot and designed derek jacobi julie christie kate winslet richard briers and many others do fine jobs then theres kenneth branagh if ever there was a vanity project for an actor this is it and mr branagh spares nothing negin putting the ham in hamlet from the stunt casting which gives us the worst performance ever by the woefully miscast jack lemmon to the bits of distracting business thrown in to infuse a sense of naturalness to his own performance which runs the gamut from throwing away the single most famous soliloquy in all of literature to screaming every line of others his performance confirms that while he may come across better on stage where bigger is necessary he has never negbeen a great film actor the scenery budget could be charged to catering mr branagh eats so much of it his performance is a perfect example of why people dont neggo to see shakespeare  full of sound and fury signifying nothing and if there is fault to his direction it is that he keeps the camera firmly glued on his overblown performanceno negmatter what theories people may posit on the bard he was after all is said and done a playwright the brilliance of his plays rest in the fact that his themes are universal and timeless although there is no right way to play his plays there is most certainly great acting good acting and bad acting shakespeare himself gives instructions to the players in the text of hamlet itself it amazes me how mr branagh mouthed it but did not neghear it it was an example of spending too much time working out how hes going to say something and too little figuring out what hes sayingwhile mr branagh has certainly done a wonderful job in mounting some entertaining productions he would be wise to stay behind the camera and allow those who know the art of acting to practice it his direction has always been better than his acting i still give him immense credit for resurrecting interest in filming shakespeare he set a great template for other productions and it would be interesting to see him onstage from about  rows back but i do hope he chooses to direct more and act lessis it worth seeing certainly there are many little joys to be found in the film but its a long long movie and by the end one may feel less that they enjoyed than survived it,1

good luck finding this film to even watch  its not negyet released on tape or dvd i saw on release in the early s was lucky enough to catch it via american cinematheques preservation efforts and it still has some tangible moments that stayed with me for thirty yearsno negreason to repeat rwints accurate comments here as a comeout director soon after the soaring success of five easy pieces jack n has been said to have managed the low budget effort as best as possible and it certainly shows in the wandering and meandering that could have used some recutting but its also a memorable icon for its time the all very intense clashes of late s college sports student movements sexual revolution and more why see this film it was probably a ground breaker in some scenes the frisky male bonding in the aftergame showers karen blacks scene with tepper in the car will catch you a little off guard  but its the first use of a word i hadnt negwitnessed in film before and the casual and unexpected use of nudity overall there are probably others im omittinglook for a nice surprise of a young cindy williams in one of her first films a thin david ogend stiers mike warren fresh out of his powderblue ucla uniform and readying for a darkblue tv uniform robert towne  actor and a whole lot of folks simply playing themselvesnow any connection between harry gittes last name robert towne and a certain character in chinatown and the two jakesit gets a  based on karen black youll see why,0

i hate to throw out lines like this but in this case i feel like i have to the american remake of the grudge is by far the worst film i have seen in theaters in the last  years there i said it and now that i have gotten that out of my system please let me explain whywhen someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage a curse is born the curse gathers in that place of death those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury that is the premise of the grudge and i will admit it sounds intriguing unfortunately the filmmakers take it no negfurther those who encounter the curse are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get you want more well too bad some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of the grudge is to scare you the problem is that when there is no negplot to speak of creepy images and sounds can only go so far director takashi shimizu pulling a george sluizer and remaking his own original films valiantly attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour  by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over it pretty much unfolds like thisperson walks into housesomething flashes by the camera andor a strange sound is heard person goes to investigatesound starts to get loudperson sees a ghostloud scream andor cat screechcut to blackbefore the audience is even given a hint of plot this exact same scenario unfolds  times in the first hour the first time was actually somewhat creepy each subsequent use became laughable as the film went on by the time the end of the film rolled around my friend and i were laughingly wondering if this scene would end with a loud scream and a cut to black we were never negproved wrongthe film has no negliner storyline instead unfolding in a series of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled i have no negproblem with nonlinear storytelling when it is done right the film jumps from time period to time period with no negrhyme or reason i havent negseen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of highlander  and this storytelling technique mars any sort of mystery that film could have possibly had if you already know the ghosts have scared two characters to death how is it shocking when their bodies are found in the attic and why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyoneobviously greenlit the second the american version of the ring made  million its first weekend the grudge is nothing negbut calculated imitation disguised as an actual movie the scariest things about the grudge are that it made  million dollars its first weekend and some people consider it the scariest movie ever made i wonder what happens to those who get consumed by the fury of paying to see the grudge,1

what a shame that a really competent director like andre de toth who specialized in slippery shifting alliances didnt negget hold of this concept first he could have helped bring out the real potential especially with the interesting character played by william bishop as the movie stands its pretty much of a mess as asserted by reviewer chipe the main problems are with the direction cheap budget and poor script the strength lies in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept characters pulled in different directions by conflicting forces what was needed was someone with vision enough to pull together the positive elements by reworking the script into some kind of coherent whole instead of the sprawling awkward mess that it is try to figure out the motivations and interplay if you can also a bigger budget could have matched up contrasting location and studio shots and gotten the locations out of the alltooobvious la outskirts the real shame lies in a waste of an excellent cast hayden taylor before his teeth were capped dehner reeves along with james millican and william bishop shortly before their untimely deaths few films illustrate the importance of an auteurwithvision more than this lowly obscure western which in the right hands could have been so much more,0

sharp wellmade documentary focusing on mardi gras beads i have always liked this approach to filmmaking  communicate ideas about a larger more complex and often inscrutable phenomenon by breaking the issue down into something familiar and close to homei am sure most people have heard stories about sweatshops and understand the basic motives behind profit and capitalism and globalisms effect on poorer nations however people feel about it rather than expound on these subjects and get up on a soapbox not negthat theres anything wrong with that other than such documentaries typically preach to the converted this documentary simply shows mardi gras beads how they are manufactured by what people and under what conditions and then how they are utilized by consumers at the end of the process it openly and starkly investigates the motivations of everyone involved in the process including workers factory management american importers and finally the consumer at the end of the chaini felt a little sickened by this equally by the mardi gras revelers but also by the way the workers in china have accepted their situation as normal and par for the course even if they have some objections to the details of how they are managed the footage of the street sweepers cleaning up the beads off the streets at the end made a particular impression but that was just my reaction i can see how someone else might read this documentary a little differentlyunlike other documentaries on this subject i dont negthink you have to have any specific political opinion to be affected by this this is ultimately a story about human beings and our relation to the goods we produce and consume if you have ever bought a product made in the far east this should give you something to think aboutoutstanding and highly recommended need to see more documentaries like this kudos to all of those involved in the making of this film,0

ah mcbainÂ… the character name is immortalized and forever ridiculed by the simpsons but it will also always  to me personally at least  remain the name and title of a tremendously entertaining and outrageously violent early s action flick directed by the cool dude who brought us the exterminator and starring two of the most ultimately badass bmovie heroes christopher walken and michael ironside the latter with a cute little macho ponytail i guess mcbain will largely have to be labeled as a guilty pleasure because theres no negway i can convince anyone this is an intellectual motion picture the film is unimaginably preposterous most action heroes take on a small gangster posse Â… mcbain takes on an entire country and yet takes itself way too seriously the script is a nonstop and incoherent spitfire of clichd situations nonsensical twists compulsory sentimental interludes grotesquely staged action sequences and utterly implausible character drawings its a totally delirious movie i loved it vietnam pow mcbains life is saved by fellow soldier roberto santos on the very last day of the war they each keep half a dollar note as a symbol that mcbain is in santos debt eighteen years later santos is a spirited rebel leading the revolution against the corrupt president of his home country columbia santos initial attempt to take over the power fails and hes publicly executed on el presidentes balcony his sister travels to new york with the dollar note and turns to mcbain for financial assistance and manpower mcbain and his former vietnam buddies who all coincidentally happen to be fed up with the injustice in this world charter themselves a miserable little plane and fly to columbia to open a gigantic can of whoopass okay lets not negfool each other here the fact youre reading a user comment on mcbain already indicates that you have some sort of interest for lowbudget bmovie action one of my fellow reviewers spent quite some time composing a list containing all the main stupidities and insensible moments of mcbain this list is totally accurate and i can only concur with it heck i could even add some more senseless sequences to that list like the preposterous and needless heroic self sacrifice of a soldier who doesnt negeven have any affinity with the goal of the mission and the rest of mcbains squad but whats the point you definitely know not negto expect a  coherent and plausible masterpiece we know from beforehand this will be a silly and exaggeratedly flamboyant movie and its maybe even the exact reason why we want to check it out this is a terrifically outrageous and exciting movie about a bunch of former vietnam buddies turning into mercenaries and declaring war against the corrupt columbian president and the national drug cartel please dont negexpect another apocalypse now this particular motion picture relies on the ruff n tuff acting performances of the macho leads a whole lot of explosions and gunfights and  last but not negleast  a fantastic soundtrack in which joan baez sings a cover of brothers in arms,0

this film was hard to get a hold of and when i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming i mean this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and gets away with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt with all of this builtin interest how could anyone make such a lackluster talkladen flick of this truelife event while williams is always interesting the screenwriters assumed that the db cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star s what we get is a typewithout any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction shame on this film for even existing,1

the john van druten broadway hit is brought to the screen with a maximum of star power in this romantic fantasy about a modernday witch who beguiles a successful manhattan publisher james stewart may get top billing but it is kim novak who steals the show as one of the most alluring witches ever to cast a spell on the movie screen the lead pairing is in fact one of the movies few weaknesses the grayhaired stewart seems a bit old for the role and while it is easy to see why he falls hard for novak its a little harder to understand what she finds attractive about him as they seem mismatched in temperment and outlook it is one of the storys amusing conceits that witches and warlocks are portrayed as greenwich village beatniks and bohemians curiously the stewartnovak pairing would generate a lot more heat in vertigo released the same year as this film but then vertigo had a compelling suspense story and the benefit of alfred hitchcocks directionthe films comic moments are mostly provided by the stellar supporting cast including a young jack lemmon as kims warlock brother elsa lanchester their ditzy aunt and ernie kovacs  as a befuddled writer hermione gingold even shows up in a hilarious cameo as a sort of grand witch theres lots to like in this moviewit romance and a great castthat is if you can possibly take your eyes off the enchanting miss novak i have seen the movie a half a dozen times and i never negcan,1
i enjoyed watching cliffhanger at the beginning when that woman sarah was full of terror when she was slipping i thought that was a terrifying scene as i would think that when you see that see your nerves in your body get to you because it makes you get full of fright and your heart beats faster i did like watching cliffhanger i think silvestar stallone is a great actor and i think hell be known as playing rambo and rocky,1
i was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was was the viewer supposed to learn something or reflect on anything here what was up with the pumpkins was i supposed to be impressed with the motel shots does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery the best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finishedi am truly amazed i believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community,1
twist endings can be really cool in a movie its especially interesting when the twist is right in front of our eyes but we just dont negpay attention those type of twist endings are the ones that make people think then weve got twists like this film has twists that whether or not negyou pay attention you have no negclue whats going to happen when they reveal this kind of random twist instead of shock its somewhat a dumbfounded reaction this film starts off like its going to be an interesting take on horror but after about  minutes its nothing negbut boring dialogue and a stupid twistthree young women are going to a concert so they get lost traveling through the woods and hit a tree trunk they end up at some old creepy ladys house who hates men and they are greeted by her homely daughter marion laurel munson strange goings on happen as these girls stay at this house for several days instead of trying to leave or get home and the suspense progresses into a dumb slasherthis film is too caught up in its dialogue and its always between only a few characters we have the main three girls the creepy spinster and the old lady and conversation of any importance does not neggo beyond these five to make matters worse they never neghave anything interesting to say its actually quite maddening sitting through their conversations we want to know whats going on and instead they just talk and talk and talk about nothingplot holes are abundant here the house these girls stay at when they get in their car accident is apparently three miles from anywherewow three miles a two hour or less walk will kill them why didnt negthey get a ride with the worker for this household who was driving into town did he have a one seater how come these girls never negquestion leaving and just willingly stay rarely even checking up on each other why did this have to have so many dumb twists maybe the answers are in the boring scripthaving a slasher film with five characters is really a bad idea its not negthrilling its not negscary and the ending is definitely out there but undoubtedly dumbmy rating   out of   mins r for nudity and violence,1
let me start out by saying i can enjoy just about any bad italian horror movie or jungle exploitation flick from the s seriously this one was downright awfulthere are way too many elements that martino negtries to inject and none negof them work except for the crocgonewild thing very well at all there are some ignorant westerners of course who set up a resort in the jungle somewhere i dont negeven remember where it takes placehow sad is that basically people come to the resort to see this native tribe and its ceremonies but eventually they upset the alligator god of the river who then proceeds to go on a rampage killing said vacationers and some tribesmen as well sounds good yeah well dont negget your hopes up there is minimal violence until the end the special effects are so bad it was like a kindergarten class performed them and the love story thrown in is laughablethere is seriously a few scenes where it appears they set up a camera underwater in a pool and threw a toy alligator like a dart into the water and that is supposed to be the gator attacking im not negkidding in another wonderfully crafted special effect a matchbox van is targeted by the incredible sinking plastic gator who all of a sudden is five times the size of a van a few minutes ago he was only big enough to eat a human but now he dwarfs a fullsize cargo van it is really pathetic the only other flick i can think of where the effects were so bad i was pulled out of the story was bruno negmatteis masterpiece rats what with the plastic rats on the conveyor belt and all who couldnt negbe terrifiednormally id say anything sergio martino negwas a solid mustsee but this one is a mustpass waste of time and definitely not negworth buying for the  sticker price from no negshame this one is a shame out of  kids,0
i suppose i always felt that hotel du nord was studiobound the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location but no negproblem  its still a much underrated lovely composition from marcel carne the plot seems a bit choppy at times as if they were making it up as they went along but because it is unpredictable holds the attention to the bitter end the money shots when the  lovers are alone in their room are saddled with some rather stilted dialogue but its all so lovely to fall into any inanity can be accepted are these  young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in prewar france or simply idiots suicide pacts are fairly common if the suicidees are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided foolsarletty played the part of prostitute well  she kept that zipper on her dress busy throughout anyway ive only seen a few films with jouvet  he is the most impressive invention as pimp in hdn  my trouble is shallow every time i see his face i think of sonnie hale in evergreena remarkably atmospheric well acted and photographed film with so much happening it needs a few viewings to get it all in place annabella and aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple francois heurtebise perier in his nd film had a small amusing part as a gay man all in all wonderful,1
not negreally spoilers in my opinion but i wanted to cover myself nevertheless as the executive producer morgan freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in  items or less a movie with an intentional indiefeel and just be absorbed in the mentorbeallthatyoucanbe theme he plays a alternate universe semiwashed up version of the real morgan freeman who is chauffeured in an old econovan by a kid all the way into carson ca from brentwood to research his next movie role why carson is a mystery to so cal residents he could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the san fernando valley and found the same elements paz vega is pretty to watch a cross between salma hayek and penelope cruz playing a disgruntled grocery checker at a large but slow local market that apparently is the ultimate source for moragn freemans research his character is only known as him to allude to how actors are regarded when encountered in real life by average peoplepsst thats him etc unfortunately i was too distracted that him had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice but had no negreliable return back to his home in brentwood carried no negcash or debit card or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him if one has such a high opinion of their self that they believe they possess an answer to everything like him does then i gotta see cash and a blackberry which displays intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve that big ego which him definitely has nothing negreally happens in this movie i dont negbelieve that either of the main characters were substantially changed by their encounter with each other it flirts with the idea of adultery but then that thought fizzles this to me was similar to steve martins shopgirl without the sexual affair it was selfindulgent for freeman and unconvincing to the audience,0

the  black and white halfhour episodes of the early situation comedy mr peepers were originally broadcast from  on nbc like a lot of baby boomers this and ding dong school are my earliest memories of television since both ran later in syndication it is hard to tell how many of these memories are actually tied to the original broadcastsmr peepers is worth checking out for more than its nostalgia value it represents a very different style of situation comedy than shows like the honeymooners and i love lucy the genre could have gone in two different directions in those days and ended up taking the loud abrasive path of those two shows which is probably why they still seem contemporary mr peepers which was differentiated by its intelligent restrained tone may appear slow and dull in comparison but its really more a matter of adjusting to the different style once you get into the characters it will win over most intelligent viewers credit should be give to the shows producer fred coe a key figure in early television whose dramatic anthologies are also worth checking out philco television playhouse lights out playhouse  producers showcase playwrights  fireside theatre etc even on kinescopemr peepers offered a much more gentle style with wally cox to be the voice of underdog a few years later in the title role robinson peepers a mildmannered high school science teacher his glasses were his trademark and a symbolic link to his name and role as a passive observer the series provided cox with an outstanding supporting cast tony randall played his brash best friend history teacher harvey weskit jack warden played frank whip the loud gym teacher whose mild bullying gave the show most of its conflict elements there is some love interest competition involving the schools nurse nancy remington patricia benoit with viewers quickly aligning with mr peepers who seems a much better match for the gentle nancy their onscreen marriage near the end  season captured national attention an early version of the who shot jr frenzythen again what do i know im only a child,0
midnight cowboy is one of those films thats been proclaimed a masterpiece with good reason  it really is one of the finest films ever made in america its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial no negwonder it was a huge success when initially released but be warned its also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made the characters are memorable welldeveloped and ultimately tragic the filmmakers should be applauded for not neggiving us the hollywood ending something which was basically mandatory by the s still this is why i treasure the years of  to  for american film its a time when wellmade innovative and most of all bleak films could be made with the big budgets that hollywood could offer all this was over by the time star wars was releasedthe direction by john schlesinger makes the material work it combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects midnight cowboy has aged quite well its still as powerful now as it was when initially released the acting however is what makes this a masterpiece the characters backgrounds are never negfully explained but the performances make them completely developed both jon voight and dustin hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic despite their sometimes reprehensible actions plus being a fan of vintage exploitation films i loved the scenes set on the infamously sleazy nd street midnight cowboy is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made,0

umi wa miteita the sea is watching was akira kurasawas swansong to film his adaptation of his favored novelist shugoro yamamotos story into a screenplay he intended to film was his final mark he left on a brilliant career director kei kumai pays homage to both kurosawa and yamamoto in presenting this visually stunning transformation of word to imageset in th century japan the story explores the lives of the women of a geisha house whose sole purpose in life is to earn money by pleasuring men the house is run by an older couple who are genteel and the geishas are an enchanting group of women who know their trade and take pride in their careers each has a reason for turning to the life of geisha oshin nagiko tono supports her family who live in a neighboring village kikuno misa shimizu has customers both good and evil whom she manages to sustain with her stories of her higher caste oshin befriends an endangered samurai falls in love with the gentle fellow only to find that he must not negmarry out of his caste and leaves his pleasures with oshin to marry his promised betrothed oshins heart bruises easily but is always supported emotionally and physicallymonetarily by kikuno negand the other geishasa handsome samurai ryosuke masatoshi nagase enters oshins life and develops the first trusted and devoted relationship with her kikuno negis beset by problems deciding whether to accept the humble love of an old man who wishes to marry her and coping with a rich but abusive customer all the while the sea is watching and as a typhoon destroys the geisha house and street oshin and kikuno negsit atop the roof waiting for the promised rescue by ryosuke the manner in which the story ends is one of sacrifice love and devotion the sea is watching and will find protection for true lovethe photography by kazuo okuhara is breathtakingly beautiful night scenes with glowing lanterns and colorful geisha interiors are matched with recurring glimpses of the sea both calm and turbulent the acting is a bit strained for edo art but the characters are well created and keep the story credible the one distraction which is definitely not negsomething kurosawa would have condoned is the tacky western music score that sounds like cheap soap opera filler except for the isolated moments when real japanese music on authentic instruments graces the track but in the end there is enough of kurosawas influence to imbue this film with his brand of dreamlike wonder that will always maintain his importance on world cinema grady harp,1
la maman et la putain is the beautifulest film of all time and whats most moving about it may be the relation between reality and art the movie deals with which is directly inspired by prousts a la recherche du temps perduindeed la maman et la putain and in search of lost time apparently tell the same story  the one of the failure of love which repeats itself endlessly the first womans name is always gilberte and the second woman appears like a twisted and deformed double of gilberte  veronika is like a whore gilberte beautiful like the night whereas gilberte was pure and beautiful like the day after the failure of the first love a second love begins but this one is like already doomed by the first one veronika takes the place of gilberte in alexandres life and in the movie she progressively eclipses her first by time to time gilbertes still coming when alexandre waits for veronikathen totally that shows its the same sad story repeating itself the same unfaithful woman like alexandre says who appears endlessly  and unfaithful is for proust the higher point in love which makes it exist but which also underlines its illusionsart is what causes the passage between whats outside  the illusion of love  to whats inside which is the truth and is a learning of this truth for instance when veronika notices the strange way alexandre makes is bed he answers that he saw it in a movie and then that a movie its made for that to learn how to live how to make a bed alexander wants to live like he was in a film he wants his life to be art this conception of art comes from proust with whom eustache shares the same rejection of political art and realism in art la maman et la putain fights against a conception of art principaly political  see for example the ironical review of a political movie by alexandre like proust says  art doesnt negcare for all this proclamations and only exists in silence first of all art is introspection and that also why realism or naturalism is rejected  art needs to transform reality to exist proust writes  i discover the illusion of realism which is a lie thats why la maman et la putain doesnt neghide its artificiality underlines by the way the actors say their text  the more you seem artificial the higher you go said eustacheeustache and proust both share this idea that the artist is a translater of a inner truth but alexandre failed where eustache succeed la maman et la putain tells us the failure of a character to be what he truly is you can sens the tragedy arise when you go further in the movie which becomes saddest you can see it in the face of alexandre who looks more and more like a livingdead you can see it by the fact that the scenes become longer and that after a while nothing neghappens outside at the end of the movie when you see alexandre writing and veronika asking if hes writing his lifeyou can guess that hes not that even literature failed the end of the movie shows the symbolic death of alexander who is smashes by the heaviness of reality and in this tiny nurses room alexandre looks more like albertine than marcelto explain this failure we can say that alexandre is a balzacs reader in forme et signification jean rousset explains that in prousts the readers of balzac who are swann and charlus are unable of any artistic creation because theyre stuck in reality which they mistake with art they see reality in art and are not negaware of the transformations that necessarily exist between the life of an artist and his work between reality and art and thats exactly alexandre he claims for instance that he loves a woman for parallel reasons because she played in a bressons for example hes like swann who falls in love with odette because she looks like a botticellis womanlife is perhaps not negmy vocation this thought is indeed by eustache who committed suicide even if its said by alexandre nevertheless there is a difference between alexandre and eustache  if eustache is absolutely alexandre alexandre is like a double without art a horrible vision of the artist which crystallizes his fearsby fallowing veronika at the end of the movie alexandre is condemned to illusions its death that remind me the last frames of the movie in the face of jeanpierre laud as well as in the endless pucking of veronika or maybe it is already hell that describes the end like in sartes huitclot and absolutely not neglike in the final liberation of le temps retrouv if eustache had read proust alexandre could never neghave finish the book  always perturbed by life and veronika when he tries to read it at his apartment or in the cafs la maman et la putain is like a inverse double of in search of lost times which tells how alexander doesnt negbecome an artist whereas a la recherche du temps perdu tells how marcel becomes a writer genetteif like baudelaire says an artiste tells reality at the light of his dream it is his nightmare that eustache tells us in la maman et la putain,0
this is surely one of the worst films ever made and released by a major hollywood studio the plot is simply stupid the dialog is written in clichs you can complete a great many sentences in the script because of this the acting is ridiculously bad especially that of rod cameron the choreography is silly and wholly unerotic one can only pity the reviewer who saw yearold yvonnes dance as sexual its merely very bad choreography the ballet scene in the films beginning is especially ludicrous if you are into bad movies and enjoy laughing at some of hollywoods turkeys this is for you i bought the colorized version on vhs making the movie even worse yvonnes heavy makeup when colored has her looking like a clown all the time and shes the best part of this film what a way to launch a career,0
when it comes to paul verhoeven and erotic thrillers most people think of basic instinct and some maybe of showgirls but verhoeven has made his best erotic thriller years before these two movies de vierde man this film is mesmerizing and mindblowing  and above all the story is absolutely plausible which makes the whole experience even more intense the performances by jeroen krabbe renee soutendijk and thom hoffman are exceptional and verhoevens direction does the rest de vierde man makes even basic instinct look quite tame it cant negget much better than this a true classic of erotic nightmare cinema  out of  at least,0
despite much style flash and glitter this french musical fails to speak the tunes are repetitive predictable and tedious the story is uninteresting as are the many characters people break into song and dance without motivation or reason most of the cast wears phony looking wigs and hairpieces and the sets look hopelessly studio boundto be honest this video of the restored version was stopped before the end so negative an effect it had on me certainly a shame to have such a multitalented cast in so feeble a final effort goes to show i guess where followups in this case to the great classic umbrellas often do go awry one cannot negrecapture only recreate,1

i have to admit i did not negfinish this movie because it was so amazingly stupid and not negworth watching i watched it with a room full of kids who also were not neglaughing at the stupid and crude humor the director bob dolman seems to be so obsessed with sphincters and genitalia that it overrides the real story that i grew up with this is not nega good film for kids besides the fact that the content is so crude the movie is just stupid has bad flow and has no negintelligence behind it what a waste of a perfectly good story if you read the book when you were younger and loved it then dont negwaste your time watching a movie that so badly botches it that it makes you angry buy your kids the book instead,1
i have read the whole a wrinkle in time book and then saw the movie the movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was  pages and the film was  hours it felt really crammed in with too many effects and bad actinga wrinkle in time is about a girl named meg charles wallace and calvin must team together to find megs father and get off the island camazotz the beginning of the film is really a stinker the acting is awful the direction is laughable and so far the situations arent negnecessary i really was crushed to see the same person madeleine engle that wrote the book and created the movie made a great book and a terrible film the acting is worse than any straighttovideo acting yes i got to admit there was cool effects but seriously they were all done terribly and not negserial in any way possible if you read the book you will be crushed by the movie i wish could give it a  but sadly i can only give it  a half could have been useful,1
i rented this movie the other night because neither negmy girlfriend or myself had ever seen it even though we had heard from a mutual friend how great it wasnow i am pretty conservative in my views but i knew going in it would be pretty liberal given who directed it i figured before the movie started michael douglas would play a compassionate popular liberal beloved by the masses and there would be a stodgy conservative opponent as his antagonist but i thought thats where the political statement would begin and endok the plot was solid single president falls for a lobbyist ok this has potential i thought to be pretty entertaining since the plot was unique but then the movie turned into a liberal infomercial the movie became more about gun control and environmental issues than it did about the relationship between the president and sydneyannette beningthere were several ridiculous premises in this movie  the character sydney playing this six figure lobbyist who is a closer could she have been more flighty she was constantly disorganized and seemed in awe of everything hardly nega closer i am an sales and she could not close selling a glass of water to a man dying of thirst secondly is there anything more ridiculous than richard dreyfuss playing a right wing fanatic this is the most liberal man in hollywood and her is playing some right wing ideologue give me a break i liked how he took his conservative character and made him as sinister as possible the speech at the end was simply ludicrous the line about i am a proud card carrying member of the aclu was a joke first no negpresident would ever admit something like that being an active member of an ultra fringe group second why even bring something like that up you just alienated off over half the movie going audience who is moderate or conservativei thought the plot was great and unique i thought michael douglas was a good choice as president but the movie went from being a movie to a left wing political statement which is why the movie failedits a shame to see a great plot ruined by hollywood having to force their political views on the audience,0
the only reason i saw this movie was for jimmy fallon who ive had a crush on since th grade which was his first year on snl i am a diehard yankees fan and i didnt negfind the movie painful until the last  minutes when they begin showing clips of the alcs games i had to cover my ears and make small noises so i wouldnt neghave to hear that which must not negbe heard but otherwise it was completely bearablei thought jimmy played the role very well because the character was supposed to be nervous and quirky and he is a nervous and quirky guy i know that it may not negbe a academy awardwinning stretch but the movie is just a light fun romantic comedy that is actually appropriate for both women and men to seejimmy and drew worked well together and they had much better chemistry on camera than other actors in the past ed burns and angelina jolie in that stupid movie what i think jimmy has a positive career ahead of him and thank goodness because taxi could have killed it i think fever pitch will help him out a lot everyone needs to stop being so critical of his acting ability because he is just starting out in movies i imagine it must be difficult and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time tom hanks russell crowe etc youll see that they started off in some flops busom buddies australian soap operas heres wishing jimmy a successful career on screen i never negwanted him to leave snl but what can you do,1
i saw this film in the worst possible circumstance id already missed  minutes when i woke up to it on an international flight between sydney and seoul i didnt negknow what i was watching i thought maybe it was a movie of the week but quickly became riveted by the performance of the lead actress playing a young woman whos child had been kidnapped the premise started taking twist and turns i didnt negsee coming and by the end credits i was scrambling through the the inflight guide to figure out what i had just watched turns out i was belatedly discovering doyeon jeon whod won best actress at cannes for the role i dont negknow if secret sunshine is typical of korean cinema but im off to the dvd store to discover more,1
i recently caught up with this little gem of a film on cable it took me by surprise even though i should have expected it from the team involved with this movie henry bromwell directed this film with a sure hand and it shows one always wonders about the secret life of hit killers one doesnt neghave to go too far to realize they probably are ones own neighbors or social acquaintances or even friends theyre no negdifferent from us at least on the surfacein this story the grandfather is a despicable character who does not neghesitate in eliminating anyone for the right price he has no negscruples in teaching the ropes to his own son and even to the grandsonalex is a man living in turmoil he knows what he has done in the past and suddenly is coming to realize the consequence of his actions he has to see someone to help him find peace with himself in going to dr parks he is trying to find absolution although he doesnt negfind it there on the contrary there is a dramatic twist when alex learns about who is supposed to kill nextalex brilliantly portrayed by william h macy mesmerizes us not negonly is he a fantastic actor but he makes us believe he is that man one of the best things in the movie is the late john ritter he is equally convincing as dr parks the man who unravels the mysterydonald sutherland as the grandfather is perfect he is a natural actor in everything he does neve campbell surprised in her pivotal role of sarah she shows a capability and range that are incredible tracey ullman is martha the suffering wife and she doesnt negget to do much also barbara bain in a rare appearance is the grandmother from hell david dorfman is a delight in the film he shows a maturity beyond his years,0
i have to admit ive caught this one a few times on the usa network theres just something about the well sheer stupidity of this flick which makes me want to watch it whenever negits on yes youre right about the subpar acting the plot which only an seven year old could like etc but i cant neghelp feeling sympathetic toward some of the actors then again a few of these actors signed up for the even more atrocious sequel,1
before the internet this movie could never neghave been made but the idea that the web is full of evil is the idea behind itunfortunately thats all it wasthe generally opinion that nowadays the web in the wring hands can create as much chaos as anything in real life since the late s somebody found out that you could create a virus which would disable a computerthe point just to do something plain evil by remote control so its the cyber equivalent of robbery with violencewhich is basically what spam is without the violenceits conning you into parting with your money and has been going so long its a wonder anybody takes any notice of it nowadays so they get cleverer and use real names as doing something illegal isnt nega priority we see the internet get worse by the weekthe social networking sites or chat room which lead to evil and the child porn sites which are illegal so the idea of a movie which invites people to click a name is just the same old thingthere actually is a site called horrorvision which is a porn sitebut this one kills the people who enter its portals the story though is so disjointed its boring with it and comes to no negconclusion the definitive movie on this theme of destroying an internet service provider has yet to be made but clearly many do need destroying as they wont negbe shut down when theres money to be made calling this a horror film is rather misleading as it bores not negfrightens,1
michael callan plays a smarmy photographer who seems nonetheless to be regarded as a perfect catch by any woman that runs across him could this have anything to do with the fact that he also coproduced the film hes a hero whom its very difficult to empathize with so the movie is in trouble right from the start however its troubles dont negend there it has the production values of a tvmovie check out that head made of clay or something near the end and the ending cheats in a way that i cant negreveal in case anyone wants to see the movie highly unlikely lets just say that the killer knows more than we were let to know he knows,1

i wished id taped men in white so i could watch it again what  you mean you really enjoyed it theo   no negi mean i could watch it again to see if it was as retarded  stupid and as embarrassingly unfunny as i can remember it a lot of people have claimed it was made for children  may i suggest it was also made by children  because the whole structure of the script lacks any type of discipline on the part of the producers and writers and much of set pieces seem to have been included because it seemed like a good idea at the time the cast dont neghelp but i genuinely started to feel sorry for them  honestly you can believe that during filming the cast had to lie to their families that they were filming a hard core porn film such was their embarrassment at having to appear in something as dismal as this  to give you an idea of how bad the acting is every time baywatch babe donna dericco disappeared from the narrative i waited patiently for her to reappear then seconds later i forgot she was in the movie  got that  a star from baywatch appears and seconds later you forget theyre in the movie  this tells you all you need to know about the standard of men in white fair enough its trying to be a live action cartoon similar to the goodies  although the dismals would be a better adjective for this movie   though perhaps the movie deserves some credit for never negdescending to toilet humour  but considering this is a kids movie  this didnt negstop itv broadcasting it at  pm  then there should be no negnear the knuckle humour in it anyway,1

in the barbarian and the geisha john wayne plays townsend harris a real envoy from the united states who was responsible for truly opening up japan to international relations in the late s before him commodore perry basically pushed into japan with gunboats and forced a treaty upon the japanese in  harris who arrived just a bit later worked through the details and helped ensure complianceas many of the japanese felt no negparticular inclination to honor negthe first treaty all this is true and shown in the film according to some other sources i found the romance between harris and a japanese geisha is mostly fiction and this romance is much of the focus of this film hence the titlemy first reaction the first time i saw this movie was one of surprise john wayne as a diplomat when hes being diplomatic in most films he says please and thank you as he pummels people so seeing him playing a man who is not nega man of action and is able to play the diplomatic game seemed very odd indeed in fact i cant negthink of too many actors in  who would have been more unusual for this role by the way ive seen photos of harris and wayne has practically no negresemblance to him at allhowever despite the story taking a lot of liberties with the truth and the strange casting the film is still very watchable the color cinematography is nice the film shows some nice insights into japanese customs and culture and the acting isnt negbad all in all a likable and watchable film despite its odd castingpsread through the trivia for this film you find out a bit more about the real life characters as well as a supposed fight between wayne and the director john huston where wayne apparently knocked him out based on what ive read about huston and the way he got along with actors this is an incident i tend to believe and its also a nice example of john wayne diplomacy,0
i absolutely hate it when a film completely falls apart near the end after youve already invested an hour into it and thats what happened with this film i was intrigued by its actors and the fact that malamud wrote its source story i havent neggone to read that story but i cannot negimagine that it ends like this film endsfortunately i didnt negpay good money to see or rent it because my library had it ohhhh such a waste of excellent acting the wife in particular was so perfectbut milo oshea as a jew now that was funny i havent negresearched into its making but it played like the director lost his marbles or died  of the way through the film before that point a story and characters were developingthere were a number of neat plot points and there wasnt negtoo much time wasted but ooh that last  hour if that wasnt negthe screwiest most worthless denouement ive ever witnessed i dont negknow what is i just hate it when ones faith is so destroyed like that it feels like an act of violence,0
only children below the age of  should be allowed to see this film the rest of us should take a book mp player or just take a nice nap to endure the experience of this event this can be best summed up as a blownup tv movie being distributed into theaters children will want to see this film and they will like and be amused by the movie,0

the trailers for this film were better than the movie what waste of talent and money wish i wouldve waited for this movie to come on dvd because at least i wouldnt negbe out  the movie totally misses the mark what could have been a great movie for all actors turned out to be a bmovie at best movie moved very slow and just when i thought it was going somewhere it almost did but then it didnt in this day and age we need unpredictable plot twists and closures in film and this film offered neither the whole thing about how everyone is a suspect is good however not negsure if it was the way it was directed the lighting the delivery of lines the writing or what but nothing negcame from it lot of hype for nothing i was very disappointed in this film and im telling everyone not negto see it the cheesy saxophone music throughout made the film worse as well and the ending had nothing negto do with the rest of the film what a disappointment,0
give me my money back give me my life back give me a bit of credit this movie was vomit worthy useless and time consuming what a waste of energy and totally pointless okay i understand the premise and the idea sound but give us a break next time just give me the money and let me spend it lost child mothers remorse blamed husband clich yes get a life sorry but this movie was a total waste of my time my money and my being i would rather watch eggs cook no negreal explanation to why this happened prison why loss obvious but why acting deserves a what am i doing here oscar and the cinematography a am i just doing this for a wage how much did this movie make well this silly fool hired a copy enough said,1
ok my girlfriend and i rented the dvd and about  minutes into the movie wed exchanged a lot of ehhh what is this movie about and more importantly do i care to find out what it ends with glances and decided we either needed drugs to keep us interested in the plot or just end the pain right there and then and watch something else we opted for the latteri liked but im a cheerleader a lot but mango kiss is too silly and surreal for my taste sorry i definitely prefer debs better than chocolate fucking ml goldfish memory and firesorcia,0

i saw this last week after picking up the dvd cheap i had wanted to see it for ages finding the plot outline very intriguing so my disappointment was great to say the least i thought the lead actor was very flat this kind of part required a performance like johny depps in the ninth gate of which this is almost a complete ripoff but i guess tv budgets dont negalways stretch to this kind of acting abilityi also the thought the direction was confused and dull serving only to remind me that carpenter hasnt negdone a decent movie since in the mouth of madness as for the story  well i was disappointed there as well there was no negway it could meet my expectation i guess but i thought the payoff and explanation was poor and the way he finally got the film anticlimactic to say the leastthis was written by one of the main contributors to aicn and you can tell he does love his cinema but i would have liked a better result from such a good initial premisei took the dvd back to the store the same day,1
while the kiss of the spider woman cast raul julia as a political prisoner in an unidentified latin american country this time he works for a dictator in a fictional latin american country specifically the dictator suddenly drops dead so julia replaces el presidente with a broadway actor richard dreyfuss shooting a movie in the country from there dreyfuss has to figure out how to be a dictator all the while balancing it with his own lifeis it appropriate to turn the tense situation in latin america into comedy well moon over parador does a good job with it no negmatter what they do in this movie they pull it off it just goes to show why richard dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors of our era and what we lost when raul julia died definitely worth seeing also starring sonia braga who costarred with raul julia in tkotsw jonathan winters and sammy davis jri agree the first lady is hot,1
as a kid my friends and i all believed that gymkata was the most violent bloody movie ever made im not negsure who started that rumor it was probably born out of the frustration of  year olds who werent negallowed to see it for one reason or other years after gymkata was released it became a perennial late night cable movie and as a result ive been able to make up for lost time i must have seen scenes from this dreadful excuse for a film over a dozen times and i can always spot it from  seconds of screen time however aside from the forced coupling of gymnastics and martial arts the bad dubbing the stiff dialog and the outrageously difficult storyline the film has some things going for it with all thats bad about the movie visually the sound is actually pretty entertaining never negbefore has a punch or kick landed with so little force and so much volume the canned kungfu sounds are cheeky but the slowed and pitcheddown music and the nearly  minute slow motion scene are truly weird the chase through the city of demented bloodthirsty villagers isnt negreally tense as much as it is irritating and there are enough bad wigs and extras who all but look into the camera and wave to make this trainwreck a little fun could it be headed for cultclassic status where is mstk when we need it,0
i give this movie a  as it is worse than the cult movies that deserve a proper  it does not negmake sense to you well it doesnt neghave to this is another vampire movie with a stupid plot no let me rephrase incredibly idiotic plot where space cowboys complete with cowboy hats battle a space race of moron vampiresdoes it get any uglier than this the only good thing in this movie was natassia malthe with her stunning norwegian beauty god i wish michael ironside and the deluise brothers would stop accepting dumb roles in dumb movies i mean at least seaquest was nice i know mr ironside from a lot of movies he has acted in  movies at this date its true that he was rarely in a major role but still,1

take this movie for what it is not nega remake but a completely different approach to the same concept its not negan epic like the original its more of a popcorn thriller visually its incredible everything else was just ok for what it is i think the movie is awesome but i like everything burton has done people need to calm down and stop acting like its the end of the world bc of this movie it wasnt negsupposed to be a remake and its not the ending was cool  i took it as a parallel universe,0
vipul shah has done some really impressive work as a filmmaker in the past waqt  the race against time and namaste london were entertaining and interesting to watch singh is kinng was fun which he produced his latest outing as a filmmaker london dreams comes up as his careers weakest farelondon dreams has a mediocre storyline its about how success turns friendship into hatred agreed it has the potential but when you watch london dreams you wonder whats happening this film has maybe the worst climax in recent times vipul shah the writer puts vipul shah the director down the first hour is boring the second hour is better but again the climax is horrendous how can anyone forgive a person who decided to destroy you i wont ajay devgn suddenly decides to go to india and ask forgiveness to his diaper buddy thanks to his uncle om puri when he reaches india rather than slapping or abusing him salman welcomes him with band baja and says he was the reason behind the entire fiasco was vipul shahs intension to show salmans character as a god if yes than youve failed completely the only question i want to ask vipul shah is that would you welcome a person who destroyed you with such a great reception write what you feel dont negfool us the audience we are sensible enough to understand whats good or not this is a musical but the music by shankareshaanloy is terrible not nega single song stays in your mind salman is superb though he carries the film on his shoulders and does really really well in the emotional scenes but again his character is shown as a god which makes him look like a retard in the end ajay is equally good but salman has overshadowed him completely asin is wasted and what is a great talent like om puri doing in this film rannvijay hams though aditya roy kapoor excels brinda parekh is alright as the vampon the whole this dream remains a dream,1
a terrible storyline amis at his worst pointless and selfconscious decadence obvious shock tactics and patchy acting make this film rather like rancid aluminium embody everything that went wrong with the muchvaunted british film revival the humour is at best limp and the pretentiousness of the whole setup including some kind of internet terrorist group  ooh how contemporary really begins to gratefinal summary  a halfbaked attempt to be edgy that does noone any favours still its always a pleasure to see katy carmichael on screen,0
a friend of mine bought this film for  and even then it was grossly overpriced despite featuring big names such as adam sandler billy bob thornton and the incredibly talented burt young this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole it uses tired bottom of the barrel comedic techniques  consistently breaking the fourth wall as sandler talks to the audience and seemingly pointless montages of hot girlsadam sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women when the ships resident comedian  the shamelessly named dickie due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender  is presumed lost at sea sandlers character shecker gets his big break dickie is not negdead hes rather locked in the bathroom presumably sea sickperhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time,0
i have always been keen on watching hong kong movies but all of them failed to meet my expectationsuntil now burning paradise doesnt negcontain the flat humor most hk movies have nor nega second rate story line that has been dragged into the film the story is not negcomplex but there are never negscenes that are just there to fill some intelligent space the only truely intelligent martial arts film i have seen is crouching tiger but since hollywood is involved it is no negtrue hk movie for me there are some incredible fight scenes in this movie from the first onewhich is one of the coolest i have ever seen yet so short to the last main scenes but mind theres also a lot of blood that flows people cut in half decapitated etc the production is pretty good and the special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be fulfilled even though some shots must be pretty technical notice the sheet of paper that he throws and got pinned into a wall yep its not negtsui hark or john woo that made my favorite hong kong film its ringo lam and im sure as hell going to check out more from this director ace,1
just bought the vhs on this film for two bucks did i waste my money hey i dig adam batman west and tina giligans island louise but hello this third rate production is a rehash of a dozen other biker films crazed bunch of bikers psychos ride into a hick town beat up everybody and everything and then are defeated in the man by a dashing hero adam west looks the part as a hero but hes missing cape and his batman uniform sorry just isnt negthe same tina l looks really nervous and frightened the whole show but at least we know what happened to ginger once she was rescued from the islandlol the bikers are a motley group and known of them ever acted again or at least shouldnt neghave hell riders is hell to watch,1
this is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes the money pit and are we done yet only points out all the more how the s movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since regretfully been losti was  when i first saw this and even at that tender age there was much i could laugh at now of course being familiar with adult frustrations i see a whole lot that i missed as a youththe three main actorscary grant myrna loy and melvyn douglasinteracted perfectly but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream its never negas easy and free of unseen complications as one envisionsall in all this is a classic comedy which still stands above the attempts to remake it,1
any child old enough to sit up in front of a screen will be absolutely captivated by the beautifully drawn images and wonderful music in this heartfelt and humorous rewrite of the grimms fairytale theyll be singing bibbitybobbityboo before they can even formulate a complete sentence and will continue singing it till their dying days it is a classic for all children especially those adults who are young at heart,1
this is a very funny movie easy to watch that entertains you almost all the time the work of the director is recognizable and the type of humor is his trademark the movie is a typical police partners history like lethal weapon but the jokes and comedy are of argentinian sort the twist is that one of them is a psychologist played by peretti and has to go with detective diaz played by luque on his assignments while he also assist him diaz is troubled because his wife cheated on him some of the dialogs are hilarious worldwide understandable and laughable anywhere is very good overall it would deserved an  but i rated  because it gets a little down at the end on a personal remark i must add that is a bravo for argentinian filmmakers considering the little good is coming lately,1
okay okay maybe not negthe greatest i mean the exorcist and psycho and a few others are hard to pass up but the shining is way up there it is however by far the best stephen king story that has been made into a movie its better than the stand better than pet sematary if not negquite as scary better than cujo better than the green mile better the dolores claiborne better than stand by me just barely though and yes its better than the shawshank redemption shut up its better i dont negcare what the imdb top  says i read that a couple of decades ago stanley kubrick was sorting through novels at his home trying to find one that might make a good movie and from the other room his wife would hear a pounding noise every half hour or so as he threw books against the wall in frustration finally she didnt neghear any noise for almost two hours and when she went to check and see if he had died in his chair or something i tell this with all due respect of course she found him concentrating on a book that he had in his hand and the book was the shining and thank god too because he went on to convert that book into one of the best horror films everstephen king can be thanked for the complexity of the story about a man who takes his wife and son up to a remote hotel to oversee it during the extremely isolated winter as he works on his writing jack nicholson can be thanked for his deadon performance as jack torrance how many movies has jack been in where he plays a character named jack as well as his flawless delivery of several nowfamous lines heeeeeeres johnny shelley duvall can be thanked for giving a performance that allows the audience to relate to jacks desires to kill her stanley kubrick can be thanked for giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch and whoever the casting director was can be thanked for scrounging up the creepiest twins on the planet to play the part of the murdered girlsone of the most significant aspects of this movie necessary for the story as a whole to have its most significant effect is the isolation and its presents flawlessly the film starts off with a lengthy scene following jack as he drives up to the old hotel for his interview for the job of the caretaker for the winter this is soon followed by the same thing following jack and his family as they drive up the windy mountain road to the hotel this time the scene is intermixed with shots of jack wendy and danny talking in the car in which kubrick managed to sneak in a quick suggestion about the evils of tv as wendy voices her concern about talking about cannibalism in front of danny who says that its okay because hes already seen it on tv see its okay he saw it on the televisionthe hotel itself is the perfect setting for a story like this to take place and its bloody past is made much more frightening by the huge echoing rooms and the long hallways these rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize the emptiness of the hotel but it is the hallways that really created most of the scariness of this movie and kubricks traditional tracking shots give the hallways a creepy threedimensional feel early in the film there is a famous tracking shot that follows danny in a large circle as he rides around the halls on his big wheel is that what those are called and his relative speed as well as the clunking made by the wheels as he goes back and forth from the hardwood floors to the throw rugs gives the feeling of not negknowing what is around the corner and being a stephen king story you expect something to jump out at you i think that the best scene in the halls as well as one of the scariest in the film is when danny is playing on the floor and a ball rolls slowly up to him he looks up and sees the long empty hallway and because the ball is something of a childs toy you expect that it must have been those horrendously creepy twins that rolled it to him anyway you get the point the shining is a damn scary moviebesides having the rare quality of being a horror film that doesnt negsuck the shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed had jack always been there like mr grady told him in the mens room was he really at that ball in  or is that just someone who looks exactly like him if he has always been the caretaker as mr grady also said does that mean that it was him that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters and not negmr grady after all its one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied thats just mediocre filmmaking for example the amityville horror which obviously copied much of the shining as far as its subject matter did this but it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think as mostly all of kubricks movies are one more thing that we can all thank stanley kubrick for and we should thank him for is for not negthrowing this book against the wall that one toss would have been cinematic tragedy,1
this is indeed a treat for every bolan fan some might think that its a little over the top and that it is only about ringo and marcs egos but i think its similar to any other concert video except for the fact that this is marc bolan not negjust any guy i especially liked the music video for children of the revolution with elton john and ringo starr this clip alone is worth all the money i cant negbelieve they didnot negrelease this version as the single the movie is really superb especially for us danes now i wasnt negalive during the s but danes in general was totally shot out from what was happening around them the media didnt negplay or show any of the popular music back then including marc bolan and trex they only played a little with the doors only the really popular songs though so i know from my dad that seeing this gives him back a part of his youth he never neggot to experiencei wont make this too long so if youre the least bit fan of marc bolan you need to see this you might find it boring or as said before a little over the top but at least youve seen one of the best musicians ever in actiononly thing that disappoints me a little is that ride a white swan isnt negon the tape but i forgive it since jeepster and get it on are so wonderfully played,0

this anime series starts out great interesting story exciting events interesting characters beautifully rendered and executed not negeverything is explained right away dangling a proverbial carrot before the viewer enticing the viewer to watch each succeeding episode but imagine the disappointment to find that the scifi thrillergiant robot adventure is only a backdrop for psychobabble and quasireligious preachy exploitation if you want to hear youre ok its good to be you after being embattled with negative slogans and the characters negative emotions then this is for you if you want a good scifi flick that is simply fun to watch forget this one both the original and the alternate endings were grossly disappointing to me all that and this movie was too preachy,1
anchors aweigh is the product of the classic mgm musical production unit and on the whole the film is every enjoyable  good music by jule styne and others excellent dancing by gene kelly and even a passable job by frank sinatra and a funny wellpaced script the only major element i would criticize would be the casting of kathryn grayson whose presence in a film always means the audience will be subjected to endless pseudooperatic warbling from the petite misskelly plays a naval serviceman named joseph brady a man with a mythic reputation around the ship as a lover but whose valentinocharms are constantly being subdued by the presence of his less cocksure friend with the improbable middleamerican name of clarence sinatra upon receiving  days of shore leave for saving clarences life joe reluctantly agrees to help clarence find a girl based on the dubious premise that he owes him something for saving his life they are drafted by a policeman rags ragland who needs them to help coax a precocious young boy dean stockwell who wants to join the navy into returning home to aunt susan grayson at first it is clarence who is interested in wooing aunt susan but eventually kellys character emerges as the more likely candidatethere are several standout musical scenes but nothing negto come close to kellys more famous work in films like singin in the rain and american in paris the closest we get is a gimmicky sequence with kellys character in a fantasy sequence dancing with jerry the mouse from tom and jerry although he seems to be closer in size to a dog or cat here than to a mouse its a startling sequence for its time but doesnt neghave enough complexity or emotion to really stand the test of time i actually enjoyed the parts of the sequence that took place prior to the animation where kelly was using semiballetic moves to emphasize the transition into the fantasy world and where we see him dance down a tunnel that looks like something right out of alice in wonderlandeventually the characters find their way to susans favorite bar a somewhat sanitized mexican restaurantbar in tijuana there the patrons happily allow ms grayson to chirp her arias with abandon and the management becomes very excited at the opportunity that clarence and joe have extended for her to sing with their friend jose iturbi playing himself with a light humorous touch of course theyve never negmet their friend iturbi and they spend much of the films length trying to reach him in an amusing scene sinatras character meets iturbi but mistakes him for a piano negtuner and urges him to abandon tuning pianos and try a professional career sneaking into the studio and the hollywood bowl where iturbi is rehearsing a surreal symphony comprised of dozens of young piano negplayers  you havent negseen anything like this outside of  fingers of dr t iturbi himself is a kind of a godfigure in the story  he represents the opportunity for salvation from the drudgery of unfulfilling work and the possibility for fame and artistic achievement for the heroine everyone is  sure that as soon as mr iturbi so much as hears ms grayson her operatic career will be a reality the  primary characters are desperate to reach him and they think of him as some kind of remote and distant mythological figure  a lot of the films charm and humor comes from the contrast of this perception to the very downtoearth real mannerisms of the maestro and speaking of iturbis contributions to the film he also provides a very stimulating musical moment with his orchestral interpretation of donkey serenadewhen all is said and done this is a film that nobody negwho enjoys musicals will want to miss the majority of the music was written for this film a nice contrast to recycled soundtracks for other kelly opuses like rain and american kelly is still at his early peak adventurous and boisterous in both his dances and his interpretation of the character sinatras voice was never negin better form and he rarely had better songs to sing stockwell is a charming addition to the clan and graysons character is endearing when she isnt negposturing on stage iturbi adds that wellgrounded but sophisticated tone that perfectly matches the atmosphere and style of the classicera mgm musical this is one of the better ones,0
i am not negsure why i like dolph lundgren i guess seeing him on screen makes me feel that anyone who works hard can succeed regardless of talent that is a good feeling for all of us who lack talent some of the other reviews point out how dumb detention is but many neglect to point out the positives any movie where at least one annoying teenager gets killed cant negbe all bad why do so many movies that have a cast of teens always need to include the stereotypical teens arent negthere any other kind of teens does every group of teens have one angry black guy one genius nerd that nobody neglikes one slutty girl who is very friendly and in this movie pregnant one disturbed antisocial white kid from a broken home who everyone agrees is talented but what is the talent and one laidback black kid who is in tune with the universe and so cool that all the other neurotic kids trust him then add a couple of generic expendable teens of any color they dont negsay much but get shot at some point detention would have been better if the bad guys had gotten to blow up the school preferably with the writers inside the dialogue is bad and the plot is worse when the bad guys and girl finally hijack a van full of drugs then they sit inside the van making out they drive the van to the school because they want to repaint the van at the schools paint shop but they never negget around to repainting the van by the way it would have been easier to just put all the drugs in another car or two cars or another van or a truck and drive away without repainting the police van they also never negmove the drugs or sell them or do anything else with the big score for some reason they decide they have to kill the kids and the teacher dolph lundgren even though when the villains take over the school nobody negis remotely aware of it because it is after school hours the handful of people still in the school have nothing negto do with painting vehicles so why go after them anyhow the best part of this movie is that the villains are all armed with numerous machine guns and they keep finding the teens including a guy in a wheel chair and they keep shooting hundreds of bullets at the teens and usually miss towards the end of the movie there is some bloodshed for every time someone gets shot there must be at least three hundred bullets fired that miss the stunts are pretty bad i read one of the reviews that says that this movie had a budget of  million and i am amazed when i saw the movie i figured maybe lundgren had done it as some kind of charity work for some film school where he is the teacher like maybe this movie was their end of the year exam it was a test to watch it but i passed,1

i rated this movie a  since the plot is so unbelievable unbelievable judge for yourself be warned the following will not negonly give away the plot but will also spoil your appetite for watching the moviea computer virus designed by a frustrated nerd sends out a code through television screens and computer monitors when the code  in the form of light  enters the eye it can access the electrical system of your body what it does is forcing the body cells into excretion of calcium within seconds after infection the patient reaches for his neck develops tunnel vision his skin will turn white of the calcium after which he falls and his hand and scull will crack in a cloud of chalk this virus is very intelligent when it finds out that a blind computer expert is trying to disassemble the code with a braille output device  operated by hands  the device is set on a very high voltage which causes severe burning wounds on the skin of the experts head the virus also senses aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an atm fortunately it could be stopped by throwing over outdated desktop pcs in a rack and electrocuting the nerd with his back on a broken computer and his feet in some spilled wateroh dear,0

i have always said that some plays by their very nature just cant negbe translated to film and this one is a prime exampleas a play this is a very funny farcical satire of the catholic church with a razor wit and a central character who is so shockingly unreal we have to root for her even when she starts murdering her parishioners one of whom made the fatal mistake of admitting he had not negsinned since his last confession so she feels she is sending him straight to heaventhats just one example of how far outside of reality the play goes and in the make believe world of the theater it works however that kind of heightened reality rarely works on film and it certainly doesnt negheredirector marshall brickman has assembled a fine cast who do great work but by presenting all this absurdity in a realistic fashion the comedy becomes tragedy and you are left with an empty feeling in the pit of your stomachseek out a production of the stage play instead you wont negbe disappointed,0

sadly its true legiunea strin exposes with absolute clarity the parameters of daneliucs irreversible failureas it was already said the author lost the faculty to coalesce his content factors and artistic intentions in a coherent form maniacally concerned with the mechanic trick of picking at random news subjects and join them together without any legitimacy he only gathers a disordered pile of events unable to follow the least storyline the scripts level is similar to a cntarea romniei amateur play about the glorious feats of socialist realism  only turned upside down while the communist line dictated a narrow concern only with positivism and sugary festivism now daneliuc is as perniciously obsessed only with negativism and disgusting scatology the ideas content is zero and the message infantile and didactic at a kindergarten levelunfortunately he also forgot the most elementary professional tenets he isnt negable anymore to organize a dramatic situation to order it in a correct movie scene to frame it right and to edit it following the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar his level of storytelling in filmimages is similar to phrasing something like holy sheet man it aint negnuthin right ere and all da people is asses what a huge distance from the impressive artist of  who had created unique works as cursa proba de microfon vntoarea de vulpi  and even croaziera and glissando sic transit gloria mundi,1

this is one of my favorite films of all time i read the book and liked it but this movie expands on everything the book made famous the acting is fantastic especially from jon voight who plays mr sir a very evil character this film has a certain way of storytelling that keeps you hooked throughout until the end where everything is pulled together for a great ending i also love the way this is directed by flashing back and forth between the modern day and stanleys ancestors stories the story was written by louis sachar yes but it seems that this story is made for film and andrew davis does a great job directing it i definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys good movies,1

this is the type of movie where it actually hurts to acknowledge that it really really sucks i normally sanctify stuff like this early s grindhouse flicks with scrumptious sounding titles and a schlocky lowbudget atmosphere usually rock house of seven corpses appeared to dispose of even more trumps since the cast is a gathering of great genre veterans including john carradine john ireland and faith domergue and the filming locations the titular house the graveyard are obviously very expedient for a gloomy tale of terror the film opens with its absolute greatest and most hauntingly memorable sequences though sadly enough theyre the only ones that qualify as such the credits are a splendid montage complete with freakish coloreffects and eerie freezeframes illustrating how the titular house received its notorious reputation the last seven owners were mysteriously murdered here and the credits montage gleefully exhibits their final moments someone falls down the balcony screaming a lady drowns in her bathtub and another female body hangs dangling from the ceiling and four more macabre tableaux needless to say the house is cursed and the awkward behavior of t caretaker mr price carradine only fortify this reputation in other words the house forms the ideal turf for the acclaimed director eric hartman john ireland to shoot his satanic horror film project the filmwithinfilm structure is what mainly causes house of seven corpses to be so boring and uneventful a lot of moviematerial is wasted on crew members putting films spools in the camera and dragging around cables or  even worse  faith domergue and charles macaulay portraying horridly intolerable actor stereotypes the plot finally gets a little interesting only a little mind you when one of the characters reads some lines from an occult book and accidentally awakes a rotting corpse in the backyard the asthmatic judging by the noises he produces zombie slowly heads for the house and kills the entire movie crew reminiscent of how the previous seven turned into corpses after a running time of approximately  minutes the film suddenly turns from humdrum into just plain weird and confusing im still unsure whether the final twist has to do with the concept of reincarnation or just coincidence and all the remaining characters suddenly seem to go undergo vast mental transformations shortly before they die for some reason i honestly regret confirming house of seven corpses is a pretty dreadful movie the locations and scenery are gloomy chilling but not negnearly used to full effect and theres a serious lack of gruesome bloodshed numerous lowbudgeted s gems were stunningly gross so the lack of financial means is no negexcuse and the filmwithinfilm murders really dont negcount even the alwaysreliable veteran stars deliver hammy performances and harrisons direction is completely uninspired not negrecommended unless you think the zero cool fourandahalf minute playing opening credits montage is worth the effort of purchasing a copy,0
i truly wish i was not negwriting this review im a christian so i waited anxiously to see this movie it seemed great  a christian movie with some fairly famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing not negthat i buy the bible code itself  you can make it say anything you want i do however believe everything inside the bible so im sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews when the movie comes on and manages to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes i had to bite my lip to stop from commenting on the terrible writing and acting while i was in the theater i would have been torn to pieces by the people cheering at the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scenes and gasping at the insanely obvious and predictable tension scenes im sure once the final credits began to roll however i could reflect there were many parts of the movie i liked  some mostly unexpected plot twists some effects that were indeed special im not negcounting the visions those were poorly done and some interesting technical work  fades sets that type of thing unfortunately i got the distinct impression that if i read the book of revelation to a monkey and set the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour i couldve gotten a better script and the music was beyond cheesy even for a bond fan who likes kinda cheesy music in scenes of action and intrigue so i wish i could be like everyone else in the theater  like the people who came out crying and breathless because of how incredible it was  but im not negsomeone who can be appeased by a writer who throws some words over a biblical shell and slaps a christian stamp on it i need a good plot and believable dialogue before i can enjoy most movies and this just didnt neghave either im sorry but i wouldnt negrecommend this film to anyone and thats the tragedy when will we see some intelligent christian fiction it has to be out there somewhere,1

i thought the movie especially the plot needs a lot of work the elements of the movie remains westernized and untrue to the attempt of trying to produce an eastern feel in the movie ill give three out of many of the flaws of the moviefirst when shen told wendy that he would help her study the history of china i was really happy that the audience would receive some information about chinese history but it turns out that the movie did not negexactly show wendy actually studying chinese history yet instead the movie only shows wendy practicing the method of remembering what she had studied which frustrated and put me in dismaysecond which really bothered me is how the characters kept mentioning about moon cakes  moon cakes this and moon cakes that and how good it tastes yet they didnt negreally mention the real significance of it the only they they talked about that had any relevance to the moon cake was the autumn festival which they did not negexplain or go in depth they could have mentioned the myth that correlates with the moon cake  the moon lady the myth starts of with how there once exists ten suns and each would rotate rising but one day all ten suns rose up drying up the land with the rising intense heat so the divine archer hou yi shot nine of the ten suns leaving only one sun there are different versions where the hou yi shot the eight out of nine suns because of his heroic contribution he was given the pill of immortality so he could live on forever in case the ten suns do rise up again but his wife chango stole it after stealing it she fled to the moon where she met a hare she then came upon an idea and told the hare to pound the pill into many piece so she could spread the pill all over earth giving everyone immortality there are a few variations of this story but throughout my childhood i most of the time heard about this version i thought details such as this would make the plot more culturally chinese orientedthe last thing i would point out is the last battle scene of the movie the teachers that were possessed by the monks were fighting the terracotta warriors the lifelike statues of the soldiers went against the idea of how important chinese history is to the chinese the terracotta warrors serves as a connection of chinas past and it was very westernized where evil must be killed in anyway possible that the monks in the movies were willing to destroy that connection it would be understandable if wendy considering she is chineseamerican and doesnt neghave full chinese knowledge had no negproblem destroying these priceless artifactsthe whole movie was westernized because it seemed that all the monks and shen want to do is fight i mean its rated tvpg due to violence which goes against the confucius thinking of cooperation and harmony it would seem more accurate that the monks try to avoid violence and try to work things out peacefully before having to resort to violenceall in all all of or either of the producer writer or director did not negdo their research thoroughly and did a messy and effortless job instead i would suggest that they either stop airing this movie or that they reshoot the movie so it contains more accurate information however i would give it credit  stars for removing one stereotype of asians and asianamericans of being smart and quiet,1

michael cacoyannis has had a relatively long career but has surprisingly few credits to his name including some real duds such as the unfunny cold war satire the day the fish came out iphigenia however is a highlight adapted by cacoyannis from the play by euripides its a superior rendering of the classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance in many years in the united states courtesy the flix channel the film is shot on an epic scale but is decidedly not nega big film with the emphasis placed on the simple story in supplication to the gods king agamemnon kostas kazakosis compelled to sacrifice his daughter iphigenia tatiana papamoschou much to the consternation of queen clytemnastrae irene papas kazakos and papas are both outstanding but it is the stunning papamoschou who brings the most interesting elements to the screen blending the innocence of childhood with the dawning realization that she is the pawn in a political game strongly recommended for fans of international cinema,0
so its really sexist and classist and i thought that it might not negbe in the beginning stages of the movie like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not negto change well he certainly changed his tune and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers the end of the movie does not negmake her a hero it makes the whole thing sad and its sad that people think it makes her a hero perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience yuck,1
the sects that capitalise on this film are well known for their claim to take the message of the bible without any alteration or extrabiblical influence the existence of this film is solely due to the fact that there is no negsuch thingif you want to know what the bornagain branch of christianity were harping on about in the seventies just look up the word rapture in a dictionary of cults and sects its quicker than sitting through this waste of celluloidpoor acting uneven sound quality and a script that could just as easily have been written by jack t chick paranoid christian conspiracy theorist for those not negfamiliar with the evangelical scene you could not negreally put this into the so bad its good category so its only audience are either those with a pamphlet collection looking to branch out or the extremely paranoid,0

a found tape about  guys having fun torturing a woman in several inhuman waysyeah spoilerfirst of all the acting made this short not negscary at all the woman seemed to have orgasms not negsuffering some of the punishments were so ridiculous whats shocking about throwing some meat or spin her in a chair if you are shooting a nonsense tape at least make it good the only part to remark is the end the hammered hand and the pierced eye the rest of the film is really poor to end the boredom the supposed story about the tape being investigated extra bullshit,1

i remember seeing this movie when i was about  and at the time it shocked me i had seen a violent movie before but i never negsaw a movie with the consequences and reality of violence this movie not negonly shows this but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness what this movie did and crash failed to do was to be truthful crash tried to show how racism was bad and crash actually had a builtin anti asian bias and to come at it from a morally superior position grand canyon came at things from such a raw and real perspective that it actually ends up on a higher ground than crash especially when you compare the endings the ending of crash is this supposedly neat little ending that ties everything up while grand canyon simply ends on a quiet note where you know nothing negmuch will change in the characters lives but thats because life just goes on too theres no negsuitable ending no negmatter how goodbad you are there is no negending of a chapter to begin another,0
this film was the first british teen movie to actually address the reality of the violent rock and roll society rather than being a lucid parody of s teenage life in an attempt to celebrate the work of liverpools junior liaison officers the opening title points out that  of potential delinquents who have been dealt with under this scheme have not negcommitted a second crime however this becomes merely a pretext to the following teendrama until the films epilogue where we are instructed that we shouldnt negfeel responsible or sorry for such delinquents however mixedup they might seemstanley baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly takes on the post of juvenile liaison officer this hardboiled character is a role typical of baker having been currently on the trail of a notorious arsonist known as the firefly and does not negrelish the distraction of the transfer however as in all good police dramas he is led back full circle by a remarkable turn of events back to his original investigationhis first case leads him to the home of two young children mary and patrick murphy played by reallife brother and sister duo who have committed a petty theft here he meets cathie satisfyingly portrayed by anne heywood their older sister whom he eventually becomes romantically involved with it quickly becomes obvious that the squalid environment of such innercity estates is a breeding ground for juvenile delinquencythe elder brother of the murphy family johnny is the leader of a gang of rock and roll hoodlums mccallum does an eyecatching turn as the americanized mixedup kid who owes more to the likes of marlon brando than any previous british star one is reminded of brandos character johnny from the wild one who led a leatherclad gang of rebellious bikers in much the same way as this films johnny leads his gangthankfully the preachiness of earlier dearden crime dramas such as the blue lamp is not negso apparent instead we are presented with several well drawnout characters on both sides of the law as the drama of the delinquents and the romantic interest between heywood and baker takes the forefrontthe plot whilst at times predictable does deliver some memorable scenes the disruptive influence that rock and roll music was thought to have had is played out in a scene where johnny abandons himself to the music leading a menacing advance on the police sergeant the most grippingly memorable piece of film however is the climatic classroom scene where a bunch of terrified school children including mary and patrick are held hostage at gunpoint by johnny obviously in the light of the reallife dumblaine massacre this scene seems all the horrifying understandably because of this the film is seldom aired or available to modern audiences,0
i am amazed at the amount of praise that is heaped on this movie by other commentators to me it was rather a disappointment especially the combination of historical facts fantasy and the main characters internal turmoil does not negwork at all in vonneguts book slaughterhouse five and even in george roy hills adaptation for the screen it does credibility is often overstretched too many questions are left open did i miss some central points or did i fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots a boy called campbell jr grows up in upstate new york at home his father has many technical trade papers and one book it has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it the boy leafs through the book his dad doesnt neglike his doing that what should this tell me the family moves away from upstate new york to berlin bang it is  the boy is a married man in berlin and a theater playwright what kind of plays does he write in what language is he successful his wife is an actress and looks glamorous the parents move back to the usa and invite their son to do the same he does not why because having grown up in germany he feels more german than american because he is successful because his wife is because he likes his life there because he likes the nazis because he is just plain lazy and doesnt neglike change dont negask mepossibly the man just does not negcare is not neginterested in politics is a kind of an existentialist he states that he is deeply in love with his wife he speaks of his republic of two meaning he and his wife there is little to no negevidence proving his love for his wife in the movie it much more seems a republic of oneon the request of an american agent campbell jr agrees to broadcast anti semitic nazi hate propaganda to american listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to american authorities who read between the lines the crucial meeting with the agent on a berlin park bench is short unexciting and anti climactic the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no negexplanation the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fastso now we have campbell jr presenting himself over the air as the last free american the scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting  although one wonders what happened when campbell jr really and honestly had to cough hiccup etc must have scrambled the messages terribly anyway the nazis lose the wife dies touring in the crimean for german troops  i never negheard such tours really happened on german front lines in ww ii campbell jr says he goes to the russian front but does not neggo is captured by an american soldier who recognizes his mug how come is dragged to a sightseeing tour in auschwitz is then released and resettled with the help of the crucial agent somewhere in the city of new yorkand this is where the story really starts bang from now on it is like a short story by paul auster it is  campbell jr lives in new york tenement as a hasbeen and mourns the loss of his wife nobody negreally cares  or do they yes somehow they do and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction auschwitz survivors a painter some american supremacists discover him and want him to be their figurehead they even find his presumed dead wife for him or is she his wife anyway in the end campbell jr calls in at the israeli consulate and they obligingly give him the big war criminal treatment placing him in the cell adjacent to adolf eichmanns he writes his life story and once this task finished hangs himself on the typewriters ribbons without getting sooty the least bitwhile i can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss i just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly negcapable of love for anyone so i found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss amazingly many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero having put his reputation at stake for playing the last free american i assume according to them this took a lot of courage as a matter of fact however the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment campbell created for himself a winwin situation as he would have been politically on the safe side no negmatter who had won the war the danger of his being uncovered never negcomes up during the first part of the storyone might argue that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody negshould bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything but even then it fails to make a point primarily i suspect because the love affair in the republic of two falls completely flat this is a pity especially if you consider that the wife was played by sheryl lee a talented versatile and sensuous actress she has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous german accent another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts confession broadcast and hidden messages but i guess this is largely unfilmable maybe i should give the book a chance,1

i wasnt negsure at first if i was watching a documentary propaganda film or dramatic presentation i guess given the time of production it was a mix of all threeadmittedly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable but you had a sense that there would be some interesting scenes as the movie went on we were able to witness what appeared to be realistic training regimens and equipmentwhere this movie came together for me was closer to the end the scenes had a realism at least as i perceived it that i havent negencountered often before you could place yourself in the action and imagine the thoughts of the young combatants this was mixed in with the usual problems of portraying passable japanese soldiers at a time when you might think real japanese actors would be somewhat scarcethe movie is excellent as a source of the state of the american mindset in  as the war waged with japan also of interest was a dig at the japanese with respect to the help the usa gave japan in past years,1
this is one of my favorite movies of all time i loved rain man with dustin hoffman and tom cruise this movie is in some ways similar but makes rain man seem artificial shallow unemotional and trivial by comparison,1
well i can honestly say that this is the first time that i experienced a film that had literally no negmeat or potatoes in it the entire film felt like it was just the salad with no negmain course the story line was fallible and laughable the characters were onedimensional the realism was out the window and the animation was done by fouryear olds does that cover it i have never negbeen more embarrassed for a concept in my entire life i have never negread the comics or seen the other programs with this character but from the looks of the other reviews i am not negoff base with my observationto begin the story moved too quickly for someone new to this character and situations i needed more built into creating the reasons instead of finding the solution i have seen other anime if you could call this one an anime that do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them there was nothing negset aside for lady death in a few short scenes we see her train with cremator and instantly become this aggressive shebeast of hell this was hard for me to swallow considering moments before she was introduced as this weak and feeble woman controlled by her father suddenly she is immersed with hatred and can do battle with an existence that has been around for millions of years this was absurd the presentation of lady death was poor to say the least i felt as if she was nothing negmore than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge on the mind for me it just didnt negwork she was nothing negmore than eyecandy for prepubescent boys wanting to ogle the mass quantities of skin that she suddenly grew on her chest when training with cremator oh i felt sick just watching her the same goes for the character of cremator who was this random person the explanation they gave wasnt negenough and instead i was left with more incoherent babbling than actual development it is a very sad day in hell when we forgo characters to show more violence and action especially in an animated featurenext there was lucifer himself let me just say that i think i could do battle with the king of hell and survive he was weak his voice was laughable and he just didnt negrepresent the image that i had in my mind it was as if disney was in control and wanted to make him semipc he lacked the darkness and corrupt nature that lucifer embodies he was not negthe ruler of hell but instead just a lackey that had a bigger place to live speaking of living or dying how can you die again in hell that was a concept that definitely needed more explanation most of the characters were worrying about dying when they didnt negeven consider the option that they were already dead that is how they got to hell i think it was this level of thinking that ruined the film for me i didnt negquite capture the notion that your soul was still in a solid body in hell but that could just be me Â… or maybe it was because there was no negdevelopment in this story there was nothing negbuilt just preparingthe battle sequences were hysterically bad the animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early s there was nothing negimpressive about the way that this film was drawn why are we america so behind on animation it is huge in asia and it is creeping in hardcore here because we keep making films like lady death that do not negchallenge or use any part of imagination we are cheap and this film shows itoverall this film was bad the animation coupled with the horrendous voice work was cheap i had head somewhere that this film as in production for a long time which is hard to understand because i think i could have made this film on my credit card the production was horrendous as well as the story nothing negwas developed leaving huge gaping plot holes that nearly everyone fell into the strength of the characters was missing and nothing negwas explained i wasted my time with this one and would like to warn others so that when death does come you dont negfind yourself in my state and regretting the fact that you wasted  minutes on this piece of garbageblah grade  out of,1
absolute masterpiece of a film goodnight mrtom has swiftly become one of my favourite films of all time nobody negshould miss out on seeing this film its just too good mrtom is perfectly portrayed by john thaw as the harsh old man who becomes a soft fatherfigure when william beechnick robinson is sent to him for evacuation almost like the town mouse and the country mouse a truly heart wrenching film the director knew exactly how to turn book into film and he has done so extremely well the film was so excellently shot that the emotions of the characters and what was happening made the audience feel a range of emotions from love to fear and these emotions could turn on a sixpence set in a time of turmoil during world war two this film also shows the difference between the cities and the countryside they are almost like different countries an absolute must see those who dont negare missing out on a truly amazing and brilliant film,1

a reasonable effort is summary for this film a good sixties film but lacking any sense of achievement maggie smith gave a decent performance which was believable enough but not negas good as she could have given other actors were just dreadful a terrible portrayal it wasnt negvery funny and so it didnt negreally achieve its genres as it wasnt negparticularly funny and it wasnt negdramatic the only genre achieved to a satisfactory level was romance target audiences were not neghit and the movie sent out confusing messages a very basic plot and a very basic storyline were not negpulled off or performed at all well and people were left confused as to why the film wasnt negas good and who the target audiences were etc however maggie was quite good and the storyline was alright with moments of capability,1
this independent bw dv feature consistently shocks amazes and amuses with its ability to create the most insane situations and then find humor and interest in them its all hilarious and ridiculous stuff yet as absurd as much of the film should be there is a heart and a reality here that keeps the film grounded keeps the entire piece from drifting into complete craziness and therein lies the real message here this film is about how we all survive in a world gone mad that seems to be the heart of the film for as insane and off the wall as things get leon the  yr old paperboyprotagonist always tries to keep it together hes like a child forever trying to catch the balloon that is floating away so that everything will work out for the best so that everyone can have what they wantthe acting in the film could have went far over the top but the exceptional cast really keeps the piece cohesive van meter is perhaps the best of the bunch here with a performance that shines through her absurd diseased tics just as the characters in the film do we overlook her sudden outbursts to see the real person underneath majkowski is a true genius here he takes the utmost ridiculous plot twists and keeps them real it is his script and his cast that help keep the whole thing afloat its a true testament to the skill of majkowski and all involved that this film with its grating plot and characters never negonce works our nerves majkowski has taken a film that could have been abrasive and repugnant and somehow given it heart and humor this is a unique film not negto be missed,1
david lynchs crude and crudely drawn take on south park presents us with a nightmare of disturbing clichs about suburban middle class families the father is a hideous monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular mouthhole from which are uttered the most horrendous guttural noises the son and mother are permanently horrified incoherent creatures for whom terror is a way of life a number of equally absurd characters are introduced throughout the serieslynch is not negfamous for his comedies ie on the air aspects of wild at heart and i am not negparticularly fond of comedies in general however there were a couple of scenes in dumbland which made me laugh out loud there are some clever bits of animated cinematography  where lynch conveys wide ranges of reaction in his characters through a syntactical arrangement of shots as opposed to facial expressions which never negreally vary in dumblandi believe lynch was really trying to give his audience a straightforward if disturbing animated comedy here interestingly he chose to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultralowbrow humor ie most will farrell films while adding elements of vicious social critique and classic cartoon violence and grossout humor while the blend doesnt negreally work very well here it is nothing negif not neglynchianworth seeing by lynch fans,0
i did not negknow for some time in my youth all that could in general be known about this film however the ways of making a film was not negwhat in fact drew my attention what made this motion picture one the most liked films even to this very day that i have ever seen was of the heroismbravery and the honor negto have served in her majestys servicethis film is not negalways what it seems and that is perhaps as it should behowever i cant say enough for the courage exhibited by sgtcutter in defense of the uniform that he too would of sacrificed his life to save from peril of the sort that they and the troop were threatened with the emergence of this thugee groupto be certain sgt cutter is the kind of individual you might suggest something about and then you watch this unequivocal belief not negonly in each other but in her majesty the queen of englandi think for all of his lust for money and the such that that character was greata reckless brave courageous soldier who did not negknow feari think grant was excellent in this roletruly a very capable rendering made compelling by the uniform that he worei never negfelt ballantine was a shoein in fact there was so much confidence in there assumptions that you might be well not negto look to close because it is still only a picturewhat do i meanthis picture is still only a motion picture and like the times in which these events take place as well as when the picture was actually made provide a look at how things were done then and what or why there are so many different opinions as to this motion picture will distract your attentionboth ballantine and machesney are equal in there dedication with both men from time to time providing a unflinching daring as to there jobs as men in the service of her majestythese three seem to bring things off rather well and i believe it is a usefuleven enjoyable interlude when ballantine has a date with destiny or so it would seem only to have fate as you would have it interveneis it believablei dont negknowi think it is very fitting when the company having escaped the clutches of death in tantrapur and they are dragging there tails as they are approaching the main gates to the regiments post when ballantine allows the other two to know that he is leaving the serviceand getting married and going into the tea businessmachesney says he could sign up for another  yearsit will make a man out of himi like that sentimenti dont negthink there is any doubt as to just what it means to have brave dependable courageous soldiers representing your very best interestswhere does this endin fact it may never negendthose interests are so well placed as to what is important in this world that i enjoy this picture today as much as perhaps i enjoyed the picture when i was ten years oldi had never negknown about the truthfulness of this film up to recently when i went into history and found the information about kalithere is quite a good deal to learn however once all is said and done about the historical significance of the goddess of kalithis motion picture takes on a quality that i refer to as intelligencethis is a very honest attempt to convey a belief in what is being attemptedi think this is an excellent filmgeorge stevens directedthere is a few items to be aware of i dont negthink all the information will jive with history however when the journalist is addressed as mrkipling things can get very emotional because all the rest are characters but this is rudyard kiplinggeorge stevens went over the top to convey a time and a time before when these events actually occurredthe information is honestcompelling and it will not negonly draw you in but you will need to understand about why we so love gunga dinthere is in the distance the black watch is out in front and they are approaching a most certain peril and possible defeat unless the troop can be warnedsgtcutter is seriously wounded and ballantine as well as machesney are restraineddin having a deep wound at the base of his back as the result of a bayonet thrust deeply into his body from behind is up to the demand of having to warn the colonel of impending perilwith a effort worthy of our most sincerest desires in this life time din slowly climbs and manages to scale the steeple which rests as the top of the tuggee templethe sound of gunga dins horn allows the approaching army to be forewarneda very large scale battle ensues and the enemy is nullifiedit is so dramatic and tense filled position that as gunga din lay dead on a pile of rocks which his bullet riddled body now showssgtcutter says good work soldieri dont negknow of any more dramatic moment nor negone where we learn what sacrifice means then when the troop is forewarned of the impending perilthe end is far from being anticlimaticit is the telling of who gunga din is and what he means now to the honored men in uniform for whom he willing sacrificedballantine knows his heart and asks the colonel to take care of his enlistment papers and this makes machesney quite pleased with the colonel being honest places the enlistment papers in his pocket to be dealt with at perhaps at a more appropriate timethe colonel says at the place where now all are gathered that we have all done enough soldiering for one long day and further comments on how pleased there efforts were in defensemachesney says he would rather here that from the colonel than get a bloomin medalthis is a very sober point and then he comes to dinnow here is a man who has no negactually status so i am going to appoint him a corporal and

i liked the movie a real lot wanted to see it just for dara tomanovich but the plot and story were ok too a very cool change in plot when you least expect it,1
i can only echo the praise of the other reviews here its a delightful film with a feelgood factor that it achieves without crossing the line into soppy sentimentality naturally sweet  no negadded sugarone small point it seems to me that the mild objections raised about ustinovs character pendelton being able to walk in and defeat the system security ignore the fact that pendelton is clearly a geniussavant at this sort of thing yes the film was pretty computer illiterate but it did show pendelton studying computers at his flat and i believe the implication was supposed to be that his gifts allowed him to simply engulf the whole subject practically overnightthere were a few odd moments when it appeared in some scenes that gnatpole was trying to test pendeltons knowledge and call his bluff im not negsure whether we were supposed to believe that pendelton cunningly weaselled his way out of these situations or whether he was actually knowledgeable enough to pass the tests  it was a little unclearcertainly he had to know enough to set up the dummy accounts presumably wallach and ustinov were relying on their own rather foggy notion of how computers worked in those days and in order to understand in detail what they were getting at its necessary to know quite what their concept was they knew there was something about procedures which was important they thought that the smart light could actually control security rather than just indicate its state they thought that the dumb user terminals features would strongly influence what could be done on the mainframe itself  though apart from things like graphics feature i dont negsee it meselfmostly i think they tried to avoid the subject of actual computer operations as far as they could and they did that rather well allowing them a bit of artistic license i dont negthink their efforts had any flaws worthy of notecd,1
if you like films that are totally bizarre then this one is for you abdullah is one mean mother with a passion for strangling people and eating ham you should check this film out just for a laugh it is a low budget scifi musical comedy cannibalistic classic if you get bored of the film half way through you should persevere just for the sake of seeing the aliens which are nothing negmore than little toy robots but in my opinion are the films highlight im the big meat eater pass me,0
sure i like short cartoons but i didnt neglike this one naturally kids would love it but then again im not nega kid anymore although i still consider myself youngi will not negtell you anything about the story for the simple reason there is no negstory how is it possible this dragon of a cartoon was nominated for an oscar well i guess its because people in the s were more happy with not negmuch than now in the present where we live everything must happen fast look at the movies nowadays and you will come to the same conclusion we live in a society that doesnt negallow men to be slow thats really a shame i wish i lived in the s because it seems so peaceful but every time has got its ups and downs i guessto conclude if you like music and frogs youll have to see this cartoon otherwise dont negspill your time on it,0
this film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not negfully realized there are two routes to take in horror films either you dont negreally explain whats going on or who the killer is like in texas chainsaw massacre or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained halloween could potentially be an example of thisunfortunately creep fails in this area i see absolutely no negreason to give a small shred of the back story for craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation no negcharacter is fully realized although the circular nature of kates character in the film is the most accomplished part of the storyin the end this story is mostly unmotivated and none negof the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty filmmaking that drag down the filmthis film will go down as another example of a film as most are that could be so much better even though it would never negbe great the only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting the characters story direction and overall writing would have benefited from a serious face liftcreep does serve a purpose as a mindless silly horror movie with no negintellectual or emotional investment but sadly thats about it,0
home room was a great movie if youve ever had drama in your life it keeps you wanting to see more wondering what the secret alicia is hiding i think i watched that movie  times in a row and never neglost interest plus i usually dont negcry over movies but this one made me cry each time i wish i could find more movies like that one all in all i thought it was a great movie the more you watch of it the more you become part of it the very end is the part that really got me when she cried when getting her diploma because it had her daughters name on it my heart felt as if it had shattered just then and how her new friend came to comfort her when she hadnt neggotten hers yet i loved it so much,1
shinobi is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story unfortunately for the audience to actually care about the people dying you have to develop the characters otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence the problem is especially compounded when you have tons of characters all of whom dieok so if you cant negbe bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way you can at least make the reasons for why they die plausible right nope here we have a war between two ninja clans with neither negside really knowing why they are fighting each other they kill each other because the emperor says so yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants all of them dead they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions thats not negstubbornness thats just plain dumbfine fine there is no negcharacter development and the plot provides no negreasonable rationale for fighting at least they die fighting in cool action scenes right yet again no in fact many of the fights arent negeven fights at all super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly and lamely in my opinion im talking about things like lalala im walking along and i neck gets slashed the end for that character not negeven halfway through the film i threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it,0
this is a truly abysmal lock stock clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script i have no negidea why so many top british actors signed up to this junk they must have been bribed a miss match of a storyline goes on forever and ever and ever and if i hadnt neghave paid good money for it id have turned it off after  minutes not negthe worst film ive ever seen that honour goes to the truly pathetic used bogroll of a movie i use the term loosely gummo i feel like suing that so called director for the lost hour and a half of my life but this trash is nearly right down there with it definitely one of the worst  films i have ever seen stuff like this reminds hollywood that they dont neghave a monopoly on truly awful films,1
set in a postapocalyptic environment cyborgs led by warlord job rein over the human population they basically keep them as livestock as they need fresh human blood to live off nea and her brother managed to survive one of their attacks when she was a kid and years have past when she came facetoface with the cyborgs again but this time shes saved by the cyborg gabriel who was created to destroy all cyborgs job and his men are on their way to capture a largely populated city while nea with revenge on mind pleads gabriel to train her in the way of killing cyborgs and shell get him to gabrielcheap lowrent cyborg  postapocalyptic foray by writer  director albert pyun who made cyborg prior to it and the blistering nemsis the same year is reasonably a misguided hunk of junk with some interesting novelties very little structure makes its way into the threadbare story as the turgid script is weak corny and overstated the leaden banter tries to be witty but it pretty much stinks and comes across being comical in the unintentional moments most of the occurring actions are pretty senseless and routine the material couldve used another polish up as it was an inspired idea swallowed up by lazy inclusions lack of a narrative and an almost jokey tone the openended cliffhanger conclusion is just too abrupt especially since a sequel has yet to be made makes it feel like that that run out of money and said time to pack up lets finish it off another day or maybe in another decade theres no negrush however it did find it rather diverting thanks largely to its quick pace some wellexecuted combat and george mooradians gliding cinematography that beautifully captured the visually arresting backdrop performances are fair kris kristoffersons dry and steely persona works perfectly as gabriel and a selfassured psychically capable kathy long pulls off the stunts expertly and with aggression however her acting is too wooden a mugging lance henriksen gives a mouthwatering performance of pure ham as the villainous cyborg leader job who constantly having a saliva meltdown scott paulin also drums up plenty of gleefulness as one of the cyborgs and gary daniels pouts about as one too pyun strikes up few exciting martial art set pieces involving some flashy vigour and gratuitous slowmotion seeping into the background is a scorching but mechanical sounding music score the special effects and makeup fx stand up fine enough watchable but not negquite a success and its minimal limitations can be a cause of that,1

i really liked the first  seasons because a lot of good characters disappeared later on like most shows are kinda slow at first then get better in later seasons but this is the absolute reverse jenny from the st season and valarie from the nd season were sabrinas friends i really didnt negcare for the others jenny and valarie were her coolest friends i think for some reason the producers wanted us to not neglike her college friends for some reason they were so cruel to sabrina but my favorite episode from season  is cat showdown and my favorite episode from season  is witch trash that is the funniest episode i also thought it was funny how libby was popular but she was always jealous of sabrina and never negseemed to have a real boyfriend but was always wanting to be with harvey i just wished they could have made more better ones i also liked how the first  seasons during the opening credits sabrina would say a few words while wearing a costume like in the pilot episode where shes in the witch costume i liked how she said this is so not negme and later on she kept trying to change herself to something else is what i think but this is a really cool show it is kinda like the andy griffith show in a way because it good at first but once it turned color and barney fife left it was longer good but i still like to watch it but the only reason i watch later seasons is because of sabrina what i meant about the opening sequence is the opening titles of seasons  shows sabrina in front of a mirror posing with several different costumes and outfits as the cast members names quickly flash on the bottom of the screen at the end sabrina would say some sort of pun that related to the outfit she is wearing then disappear the opening sequence of season four includes the characters in bubbles the opening credits of seasons  features sabrina at various locations around boston,1
i really cant think of anything good to say about this filmnot nega single thing the script is a nightmare the writer blurs the line between chemical and biological traits and doesnt seem to understand the difference youd think they would at least get a technical advisor the performances were bad by most of the cast although i dont really blame them the material really stinks the editing was equally bad ill just stop now its all bad,1
this is by far one of the most boring and horribly acted accounts of the early days of adolf hitler that i have ever watched robert carlyle is a wonderful actor but to cast him as hitler is just plain wrong to cast liev schrieber as hitlers longtime friend and aid haefengstal must have emitted cries of despair and anguish from the simon wiesenthal centre a jw playing a nazi supporter bad bad bad casting this was not negan enjoyable family film with a good historical background this was hollywood rubbish at its finest cashing in on the strength of a strong but sorely under utilized supporting cast of actors whom seemed to have all but disappeared from the acting radar in the past  yearsthe fake german accents vee vill vin zis var is insulting to german people everywhere my mother is german and she sat fuming at the sound of the voices which kept switching from americanenglishgerman all in the same sentence the supporting cast make better cardboard cutouts at the local video store than they do on screen jenna malone as the fated geli raubal was splendid though she captured the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who ultimately ended her own life to escape what her future would have been like in hitlers shadowif you would like a tremendously fantastic and historically accurate account of hitlers early years leading up to and including the warholocaust rent inside the third reich  starring rutger hauer as albert speer and derek jacobi as hitler it was good and made more sense then this baloneyas a historical researcher of the third reich i can honestly tell you this had me reaching for my books to confirm its myriad of inaccuracies,0
this film is notable for three reasonsfirst apparently capitalizing on the success of the two superman serials this low budget feature was made and released to theaters marking george reeves and phyllis coates initial appearances as clark kent  superman and lois lane part of the opening is reused in the series outside the town of silby a sixmile deep oil well penetrates the hollow earth allowing the molemen to come to the surface forget about the other holes those in the plotsecond unlike most sf invasion films of the fifties the hero plays a dominant and controlling force in preaching and enforcing tolerance and acceptance of difference against a raging mob of segregationist vigilantes no mild mannered reporter here clark kent knowledgeable and selfassertive grabs control of the situation throughout ill handle this even assisting in a hospital gown in the removal of a bullet from a moleman as superman he is gentler than clark towards the feisty lois but is also the voice of reason and tolerance as he rails against the vigilantes as nazi storm troopers third you will notice that the transition from the fleisherlike cartoon animated flying of superman in the two serials to the live action flying in the adventures of superman had not negyet been made,1

lordi was a major hype and revelation in  because they won the eurovision song contest with a notsoheavy metal song called hard rock hallelujah and appeared on stage dressed like hideous monsters but lets face it their victory most likely had very little to do with their great musical talents the eurovision contest gradually turned into one big political circus over the years and lordi probably just won because their song finally brought a little change and  even more importantly  because their whole act sort of ingeniously spoofed the whole annual event the absolute last thing lordis first and hopefully last horror film brings is change and ingenuity dark floors based on an idea of the lead singer and starring the rest of the band in supportive roles is a truly unimaginative and hopeless accumulation of clichs the immense budget dark floors supposedly is the most expensive finnish film ever definitely assures greatly macabre set pieces and impressive makeup art but whats the point where theres no negstory that is worth telling the film takes is set in a busy hospital where a bunch of people among them a father and his young daughter with an unidentifiable illness become trapped in the elevator during a power breakdown when the doors open again the floors are empty and it looks as if the hospital lies abandoned since many years already trying to reach the exit the group stumbles upon several morbid and inexplicable obstacles like eyeless corpses screaming ghosts and heavy metal monsters emerging from the floors the only three points im handing out to dark floors are exclusively intended for the scenery and the adequate tension building during the first half of the film for as long as the sinister events dont negrequire an explanation the atmosphere is quite creepy but as soon as you realize the explanation will a be very stupid or b never negcome the wholesome just collapses like an unstable house of cards lordis costumes never negreally were scary to begin with except maybe to traditional eurovision fans and in combination with a story more reminiscent to asian ghosthorror they just look downright pathetic and misfit with all the national myths and truly unique exterior filming locations i personally always presumed finland  the land of a thousand lakes  would be the ideal breeding ground for potentially horrific horror tales but i guess thats another disillusion on my account,1

the menagerie parts one and two was the only parter during the year run of the original trek series and it was because roddenberry was able to insert most of the footage from the st pilot the cage the move was made out of necessity to combat deadline problems in getting episodes produced such a sf show back in the s was a hassle to get done on time one positive outcome back then was that audiences unaware of the pilot produced almost a couple of years earlier were treated to a whole new crew and captain for these two episodes on top of the regular cast of characters as if the producers had spent double the money on these episodes to present a tv epic spanning a dozen years of starfleet history though they still used terms such as united space fleet in these early episodesthe wraparound story begins as a space mystery plot the enterprise is diverted to starbase  for unknown reasons and very soon spock is a suspect in these shenanigans astonishingly though even mccoy belabors the fact that spocks vulcan heritage makes subterfuge on his part impossible it does turn out that spock is indeed acting out some mutinous scheme to shanghai our precious starship and kidnap his former captain pike now horribly crippled well spock is half human we tend to forget or has he simply gone mad it may very well be for hes directing enterprise to talos iv a planet so offlimits its the subject of the only known death penalty on starfleets books when the jig is up theres a great scene of spock surrendering to a flabbergasted mccoy as uhura looks on in shock even kirk usually steady as a captain should be doesnt negknow what to make of his first officers illogical conductin the rd and final acts we begin to see transmitted images of a mission of the enterprise from  years prior when capt pike was commanding and spock was one of his officers we really dont negknow where all this is going and what spock hopes to accomplish  and thats another thing that makes this a very good parter  we really need to find out what its all about in the nd part not negonly is spock facing severe penalties but it looks like kirks career may be finished as well double jeopardy folks this is also the st televised episode to feature one of those shuttlecrafts none negwere available in the earlier the enemy within when the crafts were really needed theres also one of those neat matte paintings to convey the ambiance of a futuristic starbase  this was the only way to visualize such things back then finally check out kirks smug approach at the start of the episode  boy do things go sideways on him as the story progresses,1

my left foot is a pretty impressive film that tells the story of christy brown an artist who was crippled with cerebral palsy and learned to paint with his left foot the only limb in his body he had control over daniel daylewis won his first oscar as best actor for this film which im not negabsolutely certain was deserved but is still noteworthy daylewis give brown a realistic and occasionally almost humorous touch brenda fricker as browns devoted mother also won an oscar for a believable and touching role my problem with this film is that it is a bit too real at times when brown is in desperation and must help someone and do it all with his left foot the film can be difficult to watch this gives it an often depressing feel that may turn off some viewers for a time however if you look beyond that you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have handicaps and other difficulties to overcome those of us who are not negcrippled and still consider ourselves to have problems are inspired by this film because if somewhat with a much worse condition than us can overcome their difficulties we can certainly do the same thing well made occasionally enjoyable but difficult to watch may not negbe for everyone but not negbad at all out of,1

what a crappy movie the worst of the worst this movie is as entertaining as a dead slug notalentwhatsoeveractors stupid plot who wrote this script was there ever a script for this goofy movie or did the director just accidentally press the recordbutton on his camera and then decided to make the film up as they went along is this meant to be a kids movie or a comedy or what my friends younger brother is in the th grade and him and his classmates just did an amateurmovie for their schoolproject which outdid this geeky movie this is by far the worst film i have seen in my life there is just no negexcuse for this flick,0
whether you watch the regular version of this monstrosity or the mstk version you can only be impressed by the utter gall that went into this production the filmmakers insult the viewers intelligence from one end to the other and obviously couldnt negcare less that they are doing soeverything about it is rockbottom cheap even the s car in the flashback sequence to that era looks like it was hauled out of a junkyardthe hobgoblins are as you probably know realized with badlycrafted hand puppets and stuffed toys when a person is supposed to be attacked by them its clear the toy is being held by the victim to his or her own body when the critters scurry away from the two security guards this is shown or rather not negshown by the camera aiming up at the guards as they look down and turn their heads as if watching the hobgoblins scurrying past its reminiscent of the scene in the film tangents where two people are standing in the ruins of a future world surveying the wreckage and we arent negshown any of it budget constraints alloyed with utter incompetence generally mean you wont neghave anything worth showing so why try the sets were utterly laughable club scum was an obvious diner the house appears to have been a vacant house probably for rent or sale which the production company got hold of for an hour or two to do the shoot the spacecraft is something i would have been ashamed to build when i was a modelmaking  yearoldthe motivations of the characters make no negsense kevin gets denigrated by his worthless ingrate of a girlfriend because he hasnt negmade her proud of him im sure this was intended to make their reconciliation oh so touching at the end but any guy with real selfrespect would have told her to go to hell and left her nick is supposedly back from  months of army training yeah nice regulation haircut nick and seems bent on proving that our country is being defended by sadistic moronic animals who are sex maniacs kyle is a phonesex freak in red shorts who dreams of a night with a spandexclad dominatrix type but hes so effeminate that hes more likely gay than not one of the girls is a prude and the other is a sleazeand the hobgoblins at the end they all head back to the vault where theyve lived for  years why who knows who cares watch this film and be amazed at how primitive filmmaking in our modern age can be when you have an idiotic script incompetent direction actors who are so bad theyd be rejected from a high school theater production and sets worthy of edward d wood jr,1
it appears that many critics find the idea of a woody allen drama unpalatable and for good reason they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of bergman and lets not negkid ourselves critics were mostly supportive of allens bergman pretensions allens whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding what i dont negget is this why was allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating bergman but the contemporaneous brian depalma was excoriated for ripping off hitchcock in his suspensehorror films in robin woods view its a strange form of cultural snobbery i would have to agree with that,0
where would one start a review of the film snitchd james cahill god rest his soul made one of the most daring insights into the human psyche since encino negman his beautiful story unravels around a drug squad cop mcclure which is a name synonymous with a character from the simpsons who also happens to be an actor said cop delves deep into the underworld that is high school drug taking and discovers a gang war to rival that of police academy  and i mean the one where jones is racially vilified by his new partner but manages to come out with some of the funniest sounds you will ever hearcahills grasp of effects both visual and aural is electrifying the slight pause between action on screen and from the speakers adds to the drama that is snitchd a real gritty like underground thriller also kudos to his brilliant use of makeup such as the supremely convincing burn marks a gang member suffers in his showdown with an indoor barbecue yuck i feel the world of film is much less from james passing his memory will linger on and on and on reborn with every passing mention of his flagship production snitchd his insightful directors commentary released a cokehit up the nose of any discerning film goer truly appropriate with the harsh reality that is life on the streets captured in all the beauty of a roughneck punk knocking over a rubbish bin in a brawlbut i ask you why did the big bosses swimming pool look so cheap ill tell you why because thats life in santa ana baby its not negall drive bys and hastily constructed principles offices oh no there are some folk who must infiltrate the soft tattooed underbelly of street life in la to kick their way through in moves that would not negseem out of place at a school for special childrens production of double dragon the playthe only qualm i have with this film is that there was never nega sequel made come on steven spielberg come on george lucas come on guy that made revenge of the nerds  through  how hard could it be to step it up a notch and pay tribute to this great man james cahillhe discovered eva longoria you know oh yeah that he didjonah,1
i was previously unaware that in the early s devry university or was it itt tech added film to its wonderful repertoire of technical degree programs well this movie must have been the product of the class valedictorian my friend and i rented the original  boogeyman on my netflix and this movie was on the flip side of the dvd do not negwaste your time with this movie awful awful awful the filmmaker adds  main characters a woman and her therapist the woman has been having dreams about the boogeyman and his victims from the first film over  of this film is stock from the original movie the rest of the movie is the main character having the bad dreams while her therapist drones on a the narrator these scenes are shot through a filter so thick the characters glow they would make angela lansbury look  years old so to recap awful dont negwatch this movie,1
i tuned into this thing one night on a cable channel a few minutes after the credits ran so i didnt negknow who had done it at first the longer i saw it the more i started thinking jesus this looks like an albert pyun flick wasnt negquite sure though for two main reasons the photography was quite good and the utah desert scenery was beautiful and scott paulin gave an hilarious performance as simon a murderous cyborg but with some style and a sense of humor paulin must have adlibbed the many clever oneliners he shot out because albert pyun hasnt negwritten anything even remotely funny or coherent in his career unfortunately paulin doesnt neghave all that much screen time before hes gone and the movies the worse for it lance henriksen playing the evil head cyborg growls his way through his part as hes done in countless other movies like this i dont negknow what the hell kris kristofferson is doing in this thing maybe he wanted to see what the utah desert looked like and get paid for it he goes through the movie looking and sounding like he just woke up and in fact spends most of the last half of the movie on his back in a tent kathy long the nominal hero has a great body is attractive has a great body fights extremely well has a great body and doesnt neghave an iota of acting talent but that doesnt negmatter in a movie like this this being an albert pyun film its full of the trademarks that weve all come to know and love inane and idiotic dialog choppy editing and the impression that they lost a reel in the middle of the picture and figured ah nobodyll ever noticeas bad as this movie is however its a shade above most of pyuns other effortsthis is citizen kane compared to his brainnumbing adrenaline feel the rush for example the fights are pretty well done if repetitive after she knocks down eight or nine guys one after the other you find yourself saying alright already go to something else and long is very athletic and as a previous poster has noted has a great derrire its not nega good movie by any stretch of the imagination but its not neganywhere near as incoherent and incompetent as pyuns usual extravaganzas you could do worse than rent this movienot negmuch worse granted but worse nonetheless,1
shot into car from through the windscreen someone is playing someone else their latest song someone else didnt negreact according to the voiceover i just wonder how that came to be made there were too many scenes in this movie that i wondered about how come a camera was there if the scenes shot where the warhols descended on a bjm postparty are true then that was inexcusable exploitation to the max if not then it was a total fabrication either way it made me uncomfortable if that was the purpose all the way thru this movie i kept wondering how the footage came about taken at face value a nice portrait of the tortured genius we all believe ourselves to be,0

anyone who lived through the ages of revenge of the nerds and girlpower will appreciate this film it is one of those films that delivers everything you want in a spring break movie plus it makes fun of the college film genre its funny its got a cast to die for amy pohler rachel dratch sophie monk parker posey jane lynch amber tamblyn missi pyle and its guaranteed to make you laugh out loud writer actor rachel dratch is a comic genius and sophie monk is such a great villain wilson phillips omg im just repeating myself now it will live on with girls who like miranda july but feel like eating ice cream and pretending theyre dumb,1
i think this film has been somewhat overrated here there are some things to admire in it for one thing it deserves credit for being a science fictionish film which relies on its story instead of special effects and action sequences to carry the day the supporting cast is good the set design and cinematography are good and the ideas are interesting enough though they are beginning to seem a little tired after the many mediocre dark city  memento  fight club clones of recent years but the film is undone by poor characterization wooden performances from the lead actors and a laughably bad endingthe main problem i had was that the protagonist was neither neglikable nor negunlikable i realize that part of the story dictates that he should be a bit of a wait for it cipher but i was utterly unable to work up any empathy for a character that just seemed like a boring anonymous schlub of a man what character transformation there is for this sad sack is artificially forced on him by the plot lead actor jeremy northam succeeds in conveying that the protagonist is confused and hapless but fails at inspiring any sympathy for him opposite him lucy liu does what she can with a character who has no negreal personality of her own unless being the embodiment of a spymovie clich counts as personalityone of the biggest disappointments of this movie is the ending i wont neggive any spoilers here but i will say that a surprise twist at the end was telegraphed pretty clearly at least  minutes before it occurred further after being content to be a quirky ideaoriented movie for the first hour or so the last few scenes suddenly and terribly devolve into the worst kind of hollywood pap complete with big explosions and special effects the revealing of the films mcguffin at the end is poorly done and at the end the characters seem even less likable than they did before some of the films main plot threads were resolvedthe movies not negall bad though it does manage to maintain a certain low level of tension throughout most of it despite the slow pacing although i think i have a higher than average tolerance for slowpaced movies and there are some moments when the unsettled paranoiac feeling that director vincenzo natali was clearly trying to evoke rises to the surface but in the end these elements arent negenough to overcome the flaws in the films acting and script there is probably a good movie that covers these same themes and ideas but this isnt negit,1
murder by numbers is one of those movies that you expect is madefortv but isnt considering the only actor of any note is bullock although michael pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things it isnt nega great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things like remembering to lock your front door when you go out or putting clothes back on when you come out of the showerbullock plays cassie mayweather a cop with personal issues dont negthey all together with her new partner a wetlooking ben chaplin she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman nothing negunusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think theyve planned and executed the perfect murder as the investigation continues a battle of wills emerges between cassie and the main suspect richie haywood ryan goslingthe crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless bullock though she is very nice to look at is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as rodney dangerfield actually hed be better chaplin for his sins is a complete nonentity and i feel sorry that he has to put this film on his cv in his attempt to break into hollywood at least gosling and pitt as the conniving sneering suspects acquit themselves adequately as if dodgy leads werent negbad enough a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable but illogical ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to runmurder by numbers has absolutely nothing neggoing for it even a pointless nude scene by bullock wouldnt negredeem it well just a little but still not negenough to save it forgettable predictable and redundant  this is one film that isnt neggoing to move the cop genre forward as cassie probably says on her next case theres nothing negto see here people move along keep moving,0

there are a couple of prior comments here which opine about this flicks abundance of clichs throughout  and i agree completely both with regard to the characters and the dialogid read about elizabeth berklys awful performance in the equallyawful showgirls which ive never negseen  and her performance here while not negawful is barely up to the standards of lifetimes worse fare there was not nega hint of depth to her character but then there probably shouldnt neghave been if so it would have placed the film completely outofbalance since there wasnt nega hint of depth or charisma  not nega trace  in any one character performer or portrayalthe principals handling of lizs initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was laughable her husbands initial reaction and advice were likewise forrest gump attacking jennys boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic intelligent action and hell he was mentallychallengedthe smarmy unctuous lawyer excuse the redundancy father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time no negmean feat her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd also not negunknown in the professionfinally and frankly i rather enjoyed this part the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs that youd rather depend upon barney fife without andy to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community i know that most reallike cops fall a bit short of the sharpness intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the law and order series and the like  but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on lifetimefinally i found a kind of story within a story fascination with joshs concoction of his being the victim of his teacher this scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story this was something of an achievement like going from f to fminusthis whole lame situation should have been resolved  in real life  in about  minutes following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities with husband involved but then that would have precluded the contrived drama following and left an hours blank film in the camera but the writers here proved with their ending they could do even worse when the situation was finally resolved and righted this was accomplished in all of about  seconds with no negindication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any real world context for the perpetrator and his parents or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemptionthis ones a  presentation the second  because it does have some mild fascination,0
i bought the dvd version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version she saw aired in television but the version put to dvd was a disaster the lighting was poor to nonexistent and entire scenes were simply excised in one instance adele is being put to bed and we immediately cut to another scene  coming in in midsentence  where its the next night characters such as grace poole and mason are never negeven introduced leaving one to wonder if theyd dozed off for a few minutes during the moviethe dvd we saw was produced by platinum disc corp and even at  it was a gypbe careful which version of this movie you buy were sending this one back,1

despite being released on dvd by blue underground some five years ago i have never negcome across this italian sword and sorcery item on latenight italian tv and now that i have seen it for myself i know exactly why not negbecause of its directors typical predilection for extreme gore of which there is some examples to be sure or the fact that the handful of women in it parade topless all the time it is set in the dark ages after allÂ…it is quite simply very poor stuff indeed in fact i would go so far as to say that it may very well be the worst of its kind that i have yet seen and believe me i have seen plenty especially in the last few years ie following my excursion to the  venice film festival reading about how the films failure at the time of initial release is believed to have led to its directors subsequent and regrettable career nosedive into mindless lowbudget gore i can see their point i may prefer fulcis earlier giallo period  to his more popular stuff horror  myself but even on the latter his commitment was arguably unquestionable on the other hand conquest seems not negto have inspired fulci in the least  seeing how he decided to drape the proceedings with an annoyingly perpetual mist sprinkle it with incongruent characters cannibals vs werewolves anyone irrelevant gore we are treated to a gratuitous nasty cannibal dinner just before witnessing the flesheating revelers having their brains literally beaten out by their hairy antagonists and even some highly unappetizing intimacy between the masked brainslurping villainess dont negask and her slimy reptilian pet for what it is worth we have two heroes for the price of one here a young magic bowcarrying boy on some manhoodaffirming odyssey andrea occhipinti and his rambling musclebound companion jorge rivero ie frenchy from howard hawks rio lobo  who despite being called mace short for maciste perhaps seems to be there simply to drop in on his cavewoman from time to time and get his younger protg out of trouble particularly during an exceedingly unpleasant attack of the boils unfortunately even the usual saving grace of such lowbrow material comes up short here as exgoblin claudio simonettis electronic score seems awfully inappropriate at times fulci even contrives to give the film a laughably hurried coda with the surviving beefy hero going aimlessly out into the wilderness after defeating one and all with the aid of the allimportant magic bowÂ…so much for his own supposed physical strength onto his next  and thankfully unfilmed  adventure,1

amateurish in the extreme camera work especially overwrought  documentary camera operators neednt negspin around all the timethe script is truly inane and the acting is even worse on top of that the story is disjointed and meandering  with some gaping holes in logic at one point the lead wishes to get thrown in jail in order to rub shoulders with suspected alquada operatives and thus get an interview with osama i found the story entirely unbelievable as a result of so many flaws the filmmakerlead role really portrays a rash idiot frat boy the only item of interest really is that the filmmakers did in fact film on location its truly a shame they wasted their opportunity to make something interestingwho financed this crap,1
the first thing i thought after watching mystery men was how could this movie be so unpopular i found this movie so adorable and funny that its status as a bomb defies logic well i hope that in the future it becomes a cult hit and you can count me amoung its fanssimply put and without giving too much away this movie does for comic books what the princess bride did for fairy tales and who framed roger rabbit did for classic cartoons that should give you a more accurate idea of the tone of the movie then the marketing commitee it was unfortunately signed to this is one of those cases like the iron giant where the studio had no negclue what it had on its hands rent it the next time youre in the mood for something a little offbeat you wont neglisten to the beegees in the same light ever again,1
kay pollack the man behind this movie is a real great man who tries to share his life philosophy in different ways he has written a bunch of good and well written books about how to control your senses and keep your soul happy the message in most of his books and this movie is about that your thoughts in fact is what causes your problems and that the reason of your anger hardly negever is caused of what you think of the main message is that you can choose to be happy but hardly negever do thatto watch this movie and learn something very important on life you have to keep your mind very open and l i s t e n to all the hidden messages or guidelines to get through life which most of the parts in this movie contains if you listen and watch watch it with your earsyou wont neglearn the meaning of life but youll learn how to live and get the most out of itso while watching please keep in mindthe mind is like a parachute it doesnt negwork unless its open,1

meryl streep was incredible in this film she has an amazing knack for accents and she shows incredible skill in this film overall i really felt for her when lindy was being persecuted she was played realistically too she got cranky upset and unpleasant as the media and the government continued their unrelenting witchhunt i didnt negexpect much from the film initially but i really got interested in it and the movie is based on a real person and real events it turned out to be better than i had anticipated sam neill was also outstanding this is the best work ive seen from him and ive really liked him in other movies the piano for example i gave the film a  but if i could rate just the acting id give the it a  and a perfect  for streep,1

no negmovie with madeleine carroll in its cast could possibly be unwatchable that said i have to add that this british film comes close the story takes place on board the ss atlantic and its loosely based on the titanics unfinished voyage the word unsinkable is spoken the liner strikes an iceberg and we hear a heavenly choir sing nearer my god to thee the doomed passengers eventually take over the anthem in a clever bit of sound work but the year of the films release  means that a modern viewer has to accept otherwise primitive sound and many of the acting conventions of silent films and the stage these arent negproblems the films major flaw is pacing and pacing had been well developed in silents however if the dialog were delivered at a realistic speed the movies running time would be cut in half the intended effect was drama and clarity in a new medium but the result unhappily is tiresome now the films structure is preposterously illogical and inept paradoxically i found certain details of the editing quite modern in technique fine abrupt cuts from one area of the ship to another sometimes even on sound effects although were on board the atlantic from the first shot we were well over  minutes into the movie before i discovered that fact there are long intrusive musical passages by the ships dance orchestra entertaining easy sound personal stories are presented in an utterly uninvolving and unconvincing way dont negeven think of spectacle the berg is a tiny thing and the exterior damage it does to the ships hull is a minor negdent however the scenes of passengers swarming into the lifeboats  clearly staged on a real liner presumably tied up to a dock  generate great excitement other than the glorious miss carroll these sequences are the films only points of excellence as the movie and the ship near their end the screen goes totally black several times when the power generators begin to fail their last eternal blackout is the end of the film with a sunsetsunrise tacked on a clumsy symbolic effect atlantic is a cinema curiosity at best,1

i was disappointed the film was a bit predictable and did not neglive up to the hype plastered all over the box having said that the characters were well developed the windego myth was used in a unique premise and the house was pretty spooky but it just missed for me i kept waiting for that big ahhhhh or boo but it never negcamefurthermore the movie was plagued with poor filming of poor special effects thus showing to much of a bad thing and not negusing atmosphere and viewer imagination to create the horror and suspense try movies like session  or the cube if your looking for a lowbudget but well conceived horror movie,1

i read several mixed reviews and several of them downright trashed the movie i originally became interested in this project because it was being directed by tony scott and i have become very interested in his work after man on fire had such a profound impact on me before i start my review let me first say thisits wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner yet the writers and scott chose a different approachplotsimply stated its not negboring most hollywood movies give tried and true plots that they know will connect with people often ensuring the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit this plot was one of the more interesting ones i had seen in a while just for reference i recently watched the weather man and lord of war and while i will say that these movies are excellent and i enjoyed them both tremendously both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told they dont negtake any chances whatsoever and they are extremely predictable after youve watched a fair amount of american films dominos plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking oh man theyre screwed now and i feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films it has a lot of depth to it in my opinion and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it overall this is what kept me so interested in the moviecharactersi felt that the characters were accurate knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was it was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish thatchoco was also very believable his use of spanish in inappropriate situations his reactions to dominos lack of affection as well as his jealousy issues within the teamthey all rang true to me which made me feel that his character was that much more realisticrourkes character was the least interesting to me but it still rang true to me he seemed like an ordinary guy trying to make ends meet i hope thats what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because thats what i got out of it he did a very good job of showing ed in an average joe kind of way that has made his mistakes yet is still trying to liveclaremontladies i believe that they provided much needed heart to the story they werent negjust people who are out getting money to buy a bentley these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal you could empathize with them because to them this childs illness was a problem with no negother solution these characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed helpthe mobsters they made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can and i really liked that part they also padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interestingchristopher walken guysthey provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie from walkens awkward statements to the ceaseless references to the  guys being hasbeens their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyablecinematographyyesthe cinematography this is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans but in my opinion i thought it was genius the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion i considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement just like anything else i both applaud and congratulate scott the editor the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie not negonly did they go far and above with its presentation they went that much further the use of colors both extremely light and extremely dark provided the look of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life isnt negas peachy or clean as everyone else if you notice in times of less stress or conflict there were very few camera tricks if any at all this shows that scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and werent negjust doing it for the heck of it i realize that most people who watched this movie werent negexpecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but i think it was great that scott took this approach hollywood films have grown predictable and bland most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns and im glad that scott tried to make something differentgranted this movie isnt negfor everyone but to say its trash and has nothing negto offer is completely missing the point i thoroughly enjoyed this film and im glad that i spent the money for it i would recommend this to all but im sure it will only hit a chord with few i must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the sphere of mtv wont negappreciate this movie but i think many people will we should all try to enjoy it for the fact that scott and co took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique and with that in mind i think he succeeded tremendously,1

youd think the first landing on the moon would be dramatic enough without needing to make up stuff about it however this documentary seems to need to cast everything in the scariest possible light it talks about the risks associated with the lunar module and mentions armstrongs nearly fatal accident with the training vehicle as if the trainer and the spacecraft had anything to do with each other it makes the computer overload problem the  and  alarms encountered during the final landing sequence sound like a nearcatastrophe when it was just an annoyance and not nega risk to the crew at all and it takes the thirty seconds call to mean thirty seconds of fuel left before running out when its actually thirty seconds before an abort is mandatoryif you want to see a documentary or dramatization of apollo  go for from the earth to the moon or one of the pbs documentaries but skip this one,1

i felt rancid aluminium was a complete waste of two hours the plot line was thin and confusing the prestigious line up of players had some terrible dialogue and extremely questionable accents the camera work was somewhat experimental in places and although it could be seen what the director was trying to convey it just made it even more difficult to watch one of the most annoying aspects of rancid aluminium is the over use of narration throughout the film almost like the entire plot is being dictated to the audience the best performances werent neganything to do with acting in fact probably the most convincing performance came from dani behr of all people although admittedly does play the stereotypical office secretary do not negunder any circumstance go and see this movie unless you need a reason to catch up on some lost sleep there are certainly better ways to spend your hard earned cash,1

as someone who was born to a german mother and english father who spent five years in a prisoner of war camp i come from unique position one of having to deal with the various nazis on one side of the family and the victors of ww on the other this miniseries cannot negdelve into every single part of hitlers psyche and must give the viewer a general flavor of the situation at the time and as best as one can hitlers state of mind in this the series does quite well carlyle is very good as is otoole i would however liked to have got more information on the relationships with others in party because hitler did not negdo anything on his own he had people around him that followed him to the letter often without question and certainly without question later on in his murderous career what was going through goebbels goring and hesss mind it would have been helpful to see more of these relationships but i hope it will make people research the subject more it might also make people understand why someone like saddam hussein cannot negbe allowed to continue in power,0
i heard about this movie when watching vhs  most metal moments on the segment gene simmons who played a cameo and several other interviewees discussed how utterly awful this movie is unlike most people im often more curious about checking out movies that have reputations for being ridiculously bad than say a masterpiece of cinema the advantage of having that sort of attitude is half the time i find out that the movies are nowhere negnear as bad as people said and i end up enjoying them a lot more than i initially expected that was my experience with trick or treat now its hard to make a movie about a teenage boy who receives messages from a dead heavy metal star by playing one of his vintage records backwards without people scoffing at the premise sure its certainly a strange premise but one thats never negbeen done before give the filmmakers points for originality for petes sake if youre looking to buy the dvd having no negprior knowledge of the movie dont negbe fooled into thinking ozzy osbourne and gene simmons are the stars however though simmons has a thankless role ozzy does have a funny cameo as a reverend thats right a reverend who speaks out against heavy metal for one thing its funny seeing ozzy with short hair and for another thing you cant neghelp but laugh at the irony sure its a cheap shot but an effective one the acting is pretty good i found the performances convincing the teen characters are horribly clichd so expect the usual array of jocks and nerds and like in every one of these movies the pretty girl is a decent person who has sympathy for the alienated main character yet continues to go out with her jock boyfriend whys she going out with such a complete jerk in the first place because the plot needs an obstacle no negother reason but i cant negdeny that one of my guilty pleasures is watching the evil jocks in these movies go down since i was an outcast in high school the movie kept my interest for the most part but the third act is way too conventional and caused me to roll my eyes as there would be one predictable situation after another but altogether the film is not negat all bad and definitely worth viewing on a rainy day  out of,0
rawhide was a wonderful tv western series focusing on a band of trail drovers lead by the trail boss gil favor most episodes  especially from the first  seasons were really character studies of favor and his men guest stars came and went but unlike wagon train they seldom dominated the episodes they appeared in rawhide was a true gritty western and gil favor stood out as a memorable character never negto be forgotten thanks to eric flemings performance the show became a massive hit of course he was ably supported by a wonderful cast of good actors  clint eastwood sheb wooley paul brinegar steve raines james murdoch rocky shahan robert cabal all of these actors left their mark in a piece of television history rawhide captured the flavour of that time of the west that no negother series has for me as yet anyhow managed to do so later seasons tended to split the leads and give them individual story lines for me some of the time this didnt negwork  the cattle drive and the regulars provided the best stories however there were still some classic stories and rawhide remained top drawer affair the black and white photography added to a bleak realistic feel that other western series seldom managed to capture rustlers indianscommancheroes beautiful damsels in distress serial killers they all showed up to give our heroes problems the end came for the series quietly when the final season was axed less than half way through the reason  eric fleming had departed and rawhide was now a head without a body  the gritty realism was gone gil favor commanded respect and exuded authority  he was never neginfallible and this made him all the more interesting we shall not negsee his like again watch an episode whenever negyou can they seldom disappoint,0
misty ayers had a smoking body and thats all this movie was about pure exploitation flick i started playing a game with myself counting the number of times they looped the stock orchestral music and of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes case in point casually walking into a room and saying hello was scored with chase music from a roman epic id like to know why this film sat on the shelf for  years before being released what i learned from this movie that womens lowrise panties existed in  im talking sigourney weaver in the original alien movie panties at least  of the first  minutes is misty leisurely taking off and putting on her clothing except for bra and panties sadly also includes horrendous dubbing leading to a look out godzirra effect,0

shakespeare behind bars was a strangely uplifting documentary despite its content convicts at luther luckett correctional complex in lagrange kentucky who have raped murdered etcÂ… and surrounded by bad people in an obviously depressing environment find something they genuinely enjoy and can become important popular and celebrated in acting there are paralleled themes to shawshank redemption with their institutionalised natures and search for forgives and redemption for their past lives as we follow a generous non judgemental director who gives up his time each year to direct certain inmates in a chosen play by william shakespeare this time around the tempest that was cleverly portrayed with the inmates who could relate to it so much with its penetrating focus on forgiveness and redemption in which they confide and relate to we are introduced to each actor in formal interviews that are nicely paced with break up footage of them rehearsing each actor has their own story and tell of their regrets and reasons why they are there in emotional fashion with melancholic music over each in a traditional documentary sense the strongest and most respected inmate it would seem is sammie the director appears to immediately realise who the most interesting inmates were in sammie and later hal and allows a longer more in depth observation into the man and his personality his presence is felt on screen and his personal revelations come as a shock to the audience but give him such appeal in his emotional personality and a particular empathy is felt toward him hal is the same at the beginning of the film he has other things that he does to pass the time thats shown as a comfortable hobby as it were in running an on site news broadcast programme again through personal interviews and revelations self admitted by hal and nicely shot cutaways of hals body language not negthe closeups of his uncertain hand movement not negonly observed with him but others as well in particular his heart felt story about being unsure and scared of his true sexuality in a society that purely would not negaccept him as a homosexual until later on in the film where he is shown to be quite snide and rude to other inmates involved in the play as though he deems himself above all of them in particular to ron who already has a frustrating temperament in his acting the relationship between all of the inmates involved in the play is shown as one of respect and unity to achieve something great for themselves with nice if not negclichd motions of time passing by with titles etcÂ… everything seems to go right in the first act and then on the build up to the public performance things predictably go wrong an induction of one of the actors being transferred and his character being replaced by a younger newer inmate gives the narrative a nice subplot into someone who promises big but in the end disappoints all and does not neglive up to their expectation one inmate in particular bigg welcomes the new inmate actor rick with an evident will to nurture him into their beloved practise and hopefully become a good role model the film seems to capture each inmates passion so well with something the audience can relate to especially when rick is put in the hole for getting new tattoos something nicely hinted upon earlier in the film when the warden stops a random inmate in the yard and asks him when he got a tattoo thats on his arm and we learn its a punishable offence in the facility and biggs disappointment is understood deeply a happy ending it all looks great when they are performing successfully even being invited to perform elsewhere and a sense of real unity echoes around them but in the end the film brings everyone back down to earth that this is short lived and everything they ever had or wanted was and will always be taken away from them it is back to prison to pay for their crimes and no negmatter what redemption they seek in acting these plays they wont negbe free men their proud performances and recognition is undermined by the fact that they are the lowest of the low criminals and a nice halt in the uplifting music that plays in a shot of a long corridor that coincides with the lights turning off and doors shutting is a powerful image of their oppression the director seemed to be aware he was watching likable people in the documentary by given additional information at the end of the film into each actors future from the end of the film about where they are and whats happening to them now,0
when you actually find a video game to be scary or disturbing you know that the developers have done some very serious and hard work to make the whole thing work undying used the unreal engine but had very little resemblance to that game when it came to actual gameplay speaking of gameplay the pace is slowed down and the sheer difficulty in progressing through the very hard to kill enemies makes for a very unqiue gameplay experience the production values are so high that you may even forget that it is a video game the game itself is also packed with loads of secrets that you have to uncover using special vision the level design in fantastic and the weapons as well as the enemies will really shock you,1
one reason pixar has endured so well and been so successful is that while their films remain technical marvels and visual mosaics they have a story to match their style and often very moving style at that affecting charming and crossgenerational that a lot anime speaking in broad terms and a great many other animations fail to match their technical virtuosity with real substance is i think and i might be wrong partly because either the makers arent negbothered with character and plot and focus far too much on sound and image or the sheer effort that goes into making some animations is so enormous so enervating that they dont neghave the energy to create a really engaging storythat same cannot negbe said of renaissance there are flaws in its plot but ill get to that later those same flaws however are not negreflected in the visuals  renaissance is nowt short of stunning the ultrahigh contrast images sometimes so highcontrast that is nothing negbut one face or one beam of light visible and incredible detail are always impressive always a joy to behold the futuristic paris on display is the grim offspring of blade runner and brave new world dark murky quite affluent and even clean but shrouded in intrigue corporate malfeasance obsessed with beauty capital of the catwalk after all and disguising the squalor and neglect of its labyrinthine passages with a veneer of monumental sophisticated architectureits a compelling environment not negentirely original but great all the same the films muchtouted motioncapture technology and incredible attention to human and design minutiae result in images a blackandwhite photographer would die for not negthat the detail prevents entertainment because christian volckman crafts some superb action sequences a hellforleather care chase a couple of gruesomely imaginative murders several tussles in the dark and a nasty dustup in a gloomy apartment the locations are great too i want to visit the nightclub while the central character of karas is your regular offtheshelf maverick cop the other two female characters who are sisters are the real motors of the movie coming from wartorn eastern europe products of a war diaspora and a family spat theyre a compelling metaphor for europe as a wholethe film is tremendously atmospheric its dizzying swooping fauxcamera moves and adult tone making for a very engaging experience however the plot it never negbecomes more interesting than the initial hook in which indefatigable plod karas must find ilona tasuiev a dropdead gorgeous and pioneering scientist after shes snatched from the street the sinister corporation avalon is any corporation ever not negsinister which she was working for on classified projects are hellbent on her retrieval and soon karas is up to his neck in official reprimands dead bodies cigarettesmoke and narrowlymissed bullets and falling in love with ilonas sister bislane very sympathetically voiced by catherine mccormack as he plumbs the depths of the citys sordid underbelly and his own pasttextbook noir in other words but while i enjoyed the film a lot more than sin city to which it bears a passing visual resemblance the plot and resolution are dull the theme of immortality being raised but never negexamined and the shenanigans of highrolling avalon ceo paul dellenbach are also dull  undercutting a lot of the dramatic tension the basic ideas are familiar scifi genre materials and theres a nagging sense that the visuals and atmosphere are disguising the mundane materialhowever the film as a whole is lucid and perfectly coherent even if some of the scenarios the characters get into occasionally feel like excuses for displays of technical wizardry but its the projection of life in paris circa  the vision of community and creation of another city from the ground up that makes this film something to behold i may be taking it too seriously and if thats the case i can at least say that its superbly made extremely entertaining and pretty mature too and with an ambiance like no negother,1

this film is fantastic finally wellwritten characters you can love for all their good and bad pierce brosnan is flatout hysterical in this selfeffacing role i think its the best thing hes ever done hes done other roles that exhibited shades of being capable of this kind of fullyfledged work but this role finally gave him the room to run with it i almost died when he walked across the hotel lobby in his underwear and boots and greg kinnear and hope davis are a couple to aspire too as well as actors to aspire too kinnear is so goofy likable that his turn in the end is truly gratifying you give good actors good work to play with and they give us something more back,0

spoilers withinit appears that von trotta was a lot more at ease with what the balance of personal story versus history of the events than she was in her earlier film versprechen das the direction seemed carefully controlled and visually i felt it was highly appealing  especially where the visual narrative was concerned the titlesequence blend and the lighting of a new candle in modern times commemorating the deaths of various characters in the pastto clarify two points that many people have been confused byfirstly lena did not negsleep with goebbels although this may have seemed implied it was not negthe intent von trotta told me so herself and she is a very nice lady by the waysecondly the timeframe of events was in fact historically accurate the actual dates are shown on the closeup of the memorial and the prisoners were released as suddenly as in the film there is evidence showing that goebbels was annoyed about having done this and had planned to eventually recapture those he had set freeoverall what most impressed me most was that it was an original story from a much overmovied era it seems a shame that it has taken such a long time for various reasons for this film to hit our screensmore of the same please margarethe,0

prolific and highly influential filmmaker martin scorsese examines a selection of his favorite american films grouped according to three different types of directors the director as an illusionist dw griffith or f w murnau who created new editing techniques among other changes that made the appearance of sound and color later step forward the director as a smuggler filmmakers such as douglas sirk samuel fuller and mostly vincente minnelli directors who used to disguise rebellious messages in their films and the director as iconoclast those filmmakers attacking civil observations and social hangups like orson welles erich von stroheim charles chaplin nicholas ray stanley kubrick and arthur pennhe shows us how the old studio system in hollywood was though oppressive the way in which film directors found themselves progressing the medium because of how they were bound by political and financial limitations during his clips from the movies he shows us we not negonly discover films weve never negseen before that pique our interest but we also are made to see what he sees he evaluate his stylistic sensibilities along with the directors of the sequences themselvesthe idea of a film canon has been reputed as snobbish hence some movie fans and critics favor to just make lists however canon merely denotes the best and supporters of film canon argue that it is a valuable activity to identify and experience a select compilation of the best films a lot like a greatest hits tape if just as a beginning direction for film students all in all ones experience has shown that all writing about film including reviews function to construct a film canon some film canons can definitely be elitist but others can be populist as an example the internet movie databases top  movies list includes many films included on several elitist film canons but also features recent hollywood blockbusters at which many film elitists scoff like the dark knight which presently mingles in the top ten amidst the first two godfather films schindlers list and one flew over the cuckoos nest and the fluctuation of similar productions further down such as iron man sin city die hard the terminator and kill bill vol  writer scorseses taxi driver paul schrader has straightforwardly referred to his canon as elitist and contends that this is positivescorsese is never negparticularly vocal at all about his social and political ideologies but when we see this intense and admittedly obsessive history lesson on the birth and growth of american cinema in both ideological realms we see that there is really no negparticular virtue in either elitism or populism elitism concentrates all attention recognition and thus power on those deemed outstanding that discrimination could easily lead to selfindulgence much in the vein of the condescending work of jeanluc godard or the overrationalization of the production practices of a filmmaker like michael haneke yet populism invokes a belief of representative freedom as being only the assertion of the peoples will as has been previously asserted about the allencompassing misconceptions the people have about cinema populism could be the end of the potential power and impact of cinema one can only continue seeing films because it is a vital social and metaphysical practice and thats what martin scorsese spends nearly four hours here trying to tell us something which cant negbe told without being seen firsthand,1
very different topic treated in this film a straightforward and simple description of local chinese customs by looking at the daily operation of a public bath run by the old owner and his retarded son when older son returns home wrongly believing his father has died how every man in town makes his daily visit to chat play games discuss personal matters and get honest advice besides the usual spalike therapies when old man dies strong and loyal family ties make older son take charge so public bath operation is not negdisrupted and finally the arrival of modernization to end this way of spending relaxed hours and getting along the public bath has to be demolished making place for a commercial complex to be constructed,1

most italian horror lovers seem to hate this movie since because it has no negconnection to the first two demons films and with the demons iii in the title one would assume it would the problem is that this film was never negintended to be part of the demons series the distributors only a demons iii above its original title the ogre to cash in on the other films popularity the new american dvd release of this picture has the title demons iii the ogre on the box art but the film itself only says the ogre i dont negknow if past releases had the title demons iii on the actual film itself but this new release just seems to be a little white lie if you can get past the demons iii in the title you might some enjoyment in the ogre it starts out with a creep intro and stays pretty creep throughout theres no neggore and the film movies slowly but i still dug it just dont negexpect it to be like the other demons films i give the ogre  out of  italian fans should try it out,0
this document truly opened my eyes to what people outside of the united states thought about the september th attacks this film was expertly put together and presents this disaster as more than an attack on us soil the aftermath of this disaster is previewed from many different countries and perspectives i believe that this film should be more widely distributed for this point it also helps in the the healing process to finally see something other than news reports on the terrorist attacks and some of the pieces are actually funny but not negabusively so this film came highly recommended to me and i pass on the same feeling,1

drew barrymore is an actress that has gone through bad periods not negonly in her career but in her personal life too after being a prodigy child actress she descended into obscurity with mediocre films of low quality while she has recovered from that dark past this movie stays as a reminder of drew barrymores worst daysthe movie starts with an interesting premise very reminiscent to brian de palmas raising cain with a plot dealing with multiple personality disorder that sets the story for a horrorthriller barrymore stars as holly gooding a young woman who is trying to make a new life in california after a traumatic event of her past in which apparently her other personality killed her mothersuddenly her past returns to haunt her as her evil personality is back in her life willing to ruin her new found peace and her new found love in the middle of the chaos his new boyfriend patrick highsmith george newbern will try to help holly to face the demons of her pastunlike de palmas underrated thriller doppelganger is for the most part a mediocre film that not negonly never negfulfills its purpose it also concludes in one of the worst endings of movie history while barrymore is definitely not negat her best she manages to keep her dignity with an above average performance the rest of the cast however range from mediocre to painfully bad overthetop performances although leslie hope manages to be among the best of themthe script is full of clichs and de palmas influence is quite obvious while the movie tries to be original by making literary references in almost every line the dialogs are dull and the wooden acting certainly doesnt negdo any good it has a fair share of nudity and for strange reasons and excessive use of special effectsthe makeup effects are done by the outstanding knb and are really among the few good things in the movie however the bizarre overuse of the effects in the totally out of context ending decreases the impact of knbs work and makes cheesy what in a different movie would be amazingthe fact that this is a bmovie is no negexcuse for its low quality as with a better and more coherent script this could had been an interesting movie sadly all we have here is a mediocre film that gets worse every second worthy for barrymores beauty,1
i was very disappointed in this movie plotwise it was weak bordering on silly souls who can affect reality in the way they do a mission apparently critical to the soul hunters entrusted to one of their younger members and the whole bstory with the holobrothel and the lawsuit against the station was so awful that at one point i blurted out to the television why are you wasting my time with thisthematically river of souls didnt negreally go into the question of the soul in any more depth than the original episode soul hunter did we see that soul hunters can make mistakes but we still dont negget a feeling for their culture are there any female soul huntersthe acting was okay given the material they had to work with and the special effects  especially the planetscapes in the first act  were very impressive but overall id say give this one a miss,1

ang lee clearly likes to ease into a film to catch action characters and setting on the hoof as they emerge covering the haphazard endgame of the american civil war via the haphazard actions of a young militia unformed in mind or manhood this is an ideal approach the film turns out to be about the formation of personalities adulthood and relationships lee also shows the beautiful panoramas of the midsouth as a silent character enduring the strife like a hardy parentjames schamus script is probably the standard bearer for this film close behind it are a number of wellappointed performances that carry it admirably jeffrey wrights name alone could carry this film for me hes brilliant here but in a slow burning role instead we are treated to very good if not negrevelatory performances from a large often recognisable ensemblea noble optimistic film one to watch if you dont negfancy the harder more bittersweet cold mountain or the claim for example,1
terriblejust terrible probably the worst film i have ever seen and i did see some pretty bad pictures throughout the years the sound sucks so does the quality of the picture the direction the actingetc etc the only good shoots meaning funny because theyre so bad  are the special effects overall there are about  minutes worth of laughs the rest of the flick gives you brain damage,0
despite an overall pleasing plot and expensive production one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes where were the japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants not negon the payroll apparently a japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities she watched unfold before her eyes in a later conversation she said imagine a finnish director making a movie in fnnish about the american civil war using blond swedish actors as union army and frenchmen as the confederates worse imagine dressing the scarlet ohara female lead in a period hoop skirt missing the hoop and sporting a s hairdo maybe some people in finland might not negrealize that the hoop skirt was missing the hoop or recognize the bizarre jane mansfield hair but in atlanta they would not negbelieve their eyes or earsand be laughing in the aislesexcellent story and photography be damnedsowatching memoirs of a geisha was painful for anyone familiar with japanese cultural nuances actual geisha or japanese dress and that was the topic of the movie hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making they frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films refinement embarrassingly wrong i thought the last samurai was the crowning achievement of how bad an otherwise good film on japan could be memoirs of a geisha is embarrassingly better and worse at the same time,0
the hazing is one of them films i always wanted to see solely based on the illustrated cover image here on imdb yes thats how shallow i am i dont negcare if ten million people call it a crap movie the poster looks awesome so i guess ill just have to see it Â… now the hazing can somewhat be described like its alternate title curious the poster and title make it sound like a genuine horror movie set on campus and dealing with sinister initiation rites but this movie is actually more of a crossbreed between comedy and thriller first of all theres something very wrong with the tagline on the old vhs box i watched it says he had good grades a good girl and good buddies Â… until they put him through the hazing thats not negthe case actually protagonist gilbert lewis is finally accepted by an acclaimed campus through an athletics scholarship it takes over half the movie before we even hear about his girlfriend back home and the only buddy he has is a very nerdy charles martin smith still with hair in this film both of them are approached to become members of the prestigious delts fraternity but during their hazing exam  in which they have to descend a mountain dressed in their tidy white undies  barney falls off a cliff and breaks his leg when lewis returns with the other frat boys barney froze to death already together they intended to keep the body frozen for five days and then claim he never negreturned from a weekend skitrip with barneys body hidden in the cafeteria freezer lewis has to cover for him so that barneys absence doesnt neglook suspicious the setup of the hazing is quite original and potentially innovative but the problem here is that the execution could easily have been a lot better the tone is too steady and too serious for a comedy movie even a black one but on the other hand there arent negany proper attempts to build up suspense or thrills neither the soundtrack is cheerful and full of lightheaded tunes but thats nearly not negenough to make this film a comedy around an hour into the film the plot also runs out of steam and idea and the makers have no negbetter alternative to fill up the emptiness with romantic compilations of lewis and his outer town girlfriend biking through the countryside i didnt neglike the final twist because its quite implausible and because it has been done numerous times before and after though admittedly after the hazing is not nega complete waste of time but still im glad i found an exrental tape at a friends house instead of having to spend any money on the recently released dvd,1

following a sitcom plot is so mindlessly easy that having her character simultaneously operate both within and without the context the rest of the cast inhabit is the kind of experimentalism that sitcoms could really use the supporting characters ground the show in a sitcom reality which provides a contextual counterpoint to sarahs erratic persona which beyond general insensitivity has no negspecific recurring traits for behavioural expectations to be based on making her less a character than a canvas to be repainted in every episode if not negscene sarahs ability to see everything from an outside perspective enables her to parody aspects of social behaviour that are subtle enough to usually go unnoticed every time she speaks its like a selfcontained  second skit she overemotes a lot demonstrating the countless things a smile or change in vocal pitch can signify but never negsticks with one idea long enough for you to get comfortable and form expectations that will be satisfied this may be the most creative original and experimental tv program ever,0

for the first three seasons sabrina was a gem hidden away on tgif and later early schoolday afternoon reruns each episode had a maniac zany energy and rapidfire pacing that overcame the occasional awkward joke melissa joan hart exuded a keen talent for physical comedy particularly in her facial expressions her two aunts playing the straight men or as straight as two witches could be had great comic timing and general chemistry with hart salem as a talking cat was free to dabble in whatever mad scheme he was interested in and one could laugh and take it all in stride because he was after all a talking cat sabrinas friends rounded out the social experience at school in which also housed the typical evil cheerleader and totalitarian principal perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the show was the ability to merge pop culture eg bands of the era jerry springer archetypal human conditionmorality eg the importance of friendship the spirit of christmas and the literal representation of such related metaphors in the magical realm unfortunately like so many other shows throughout the age of television the show hit its peak during the first three years which coincided with sabrina attending high school starting in season four the move to college marked what would become a precipitous decline in the general quality of the show particularly when the writers chose to introduce josh as harveys rival and concocting thin excuses for aunts hilda and zelda to remain onscreen as key players the final season where sabrina works at a pop culture magazine was unequivocally disappointing still in the end sabrina particularly the high school years remains a unique entry as a hybrid situational comedy with magical elements that elevates it above the tiresome fare that is produced in this genre every year,1

often tagged as a comedy the man in the white suit is laying out far more than a chuckle here and theresidney stratton is an eccentric inventor who isnt neggetting the chances to flourish his inventions on the world because nobody negpays him notice he merely is the odd ball odd job man about the place as it were after bluffing his way into birnleys textile mill he uses their laboratory to achieve his goal of inventing a fabric that not negonly never negwears out but also never negneeds to be cleaned he is at first proclaimed a genius and those who ignored him at first suddenly want a big piece of him but then the doom portents of an industry going bust rears its head and acclaim quickly turns to something far more scaryyes the film is very funny in fact some scenes are dam hilarious but its the satirical edge to the film that lifts it way above the ordinary to me the contradictions about the advent of technology is a crucial theme here do we want inventions that save us fortunes whilst closing down industries  you only have to see what happened to the coal industry in britain to know what im on about the decade the film was made is a crucial point to note the making of nuclear weapons became more than just hearsay science was advancing to frighteningly new proportions you watch this film and see the quick turnaround of events for the main protagonist stanley from hero to enemy in one foul swoop a victim of his own pursuit to better mankind  its so dark the film should of been called the man in the black suiti honestly cant negfind anything wrong in this film the script from roger macdougall john dighton and director alex mackendrick could be filmed today and it wouldnt negbe out of place such is the sharpness and thought of mind it has the sound and setting is tremendous the direction is seamless with the tonal shift adroitly handled by mackendrick some of the scenes are just wonderful one in particular tugs on the heart strings and brings one to think of a certain scene in david lynchs elephant man some  years later and yet after such a downturn of events the film still manages to take a wink as the genius that is alec guinness gets to close out the film to keep the viewers pondering not negonly the future of stanley but also the rest of us in this rapidly advancing worlda timeless masterpiece thematically and as a piece of art,0
spoilers included this film surely is the best amicus production ive seen so far even though i still have quite a few to check out the house that dripped blood is a horroromnibusÂ…an anthology that contains four uncanny stories involving the tenants of a vicious hellish house in the british countryside a common mistake in productions like this is wasting too much energy on the wraparound story that connects the separate talesÂ…peter duffels film wisely doesnt negpay too much attention to that it simply handles about a scotland yard inspector who comes to the house to investigate the disappearance of the last tenant and like that he learns about the bizarre events that took place there before all four stories in this film are of high qualitylevel and together they make a perfect wholesome high expectations are allowed for this film since it was entirely written by robert bloch yes the same bloch who wrote the novel that resulted in the brilliant horror milestone psychoÂ… were also marking peter duffels solid and very professional debut as a director the four stories  chapters if you will  in the house that dripped blood contain a good diversity in topics but theyre almost equally chilling and eerie number one handles about a horrorauthor who comes to the house along with his wife in order to find inspiration for his new book this starts out real well but after a short while his haunted and stalked by the villain of his own imagination the idea in this tale isnt negexactly originalÂ…but its very suspenseful and the climax is rather surprising the second story stars hammer horrorlegend peter cushing as a retired stockbroker still haunted by the image of an unreachable and longlost love he bumps into a wax statue that looks exactly like her cushing is a joy to observe as always and  even though the topic of wax museums isnt negnew  this story looks overall fresh and innovating this chapter also contains a couple of delightful shockmoments and theres a constant tense atmosphere its a terrific warmup for what is arguably the best story number  another legendary actor in this one as christopher lee gives away a flawless portrayal of a terrified father hes very severe and strict regarding his young daughter and he keeps her in isolation for the outside world not negwithout reason since the little girl shows a bizarre fascination for witchcraft and voodoo besides great acting by lee and the remarkable performance of chloe franks as the spooky kid this story also has a terrific gothic atmosphere the devilish undertones in this story along with the creepy sound effects of thunder make this story a must for fans of authentic horror the fourth and final story in which a vain horror actor gets controlled by the vampirecloak he wears is slightly weaker then the others when it comes to tension and credibility but that the overload of subtle humor more or less compensates that theres even a little room for parody in this story as the protagonist refers to costar christopher lee in the dracula series most memorable element in this last chapter is the presence of the gorgeous ingrid pitt the cultqueen from the vampire lovers certainly is one of the many highlights in the filmÂ…her cleavage in particular no negdoubt about itÂ…the house that dripped blood will be greatly appreciated by classic horror fans i truly believe that with a bit of moodsettling preparations this could actually be one of the few movies thatll terrify you and leave a big impression intelligent and compelling horror like it should be highly recommended one extra little remark though this film may notÂ…negrepeat may not negunder any circumstances be confused with the dorm that dripped blood this latter one is a very irritating and lousy underground s slasher that has got nothing negin common with this film except for the title it stole,0

if you were ever sad for not negbeing able to get a movie on dvd it was probably delirious you were looking for how often do you laugh when watching stand up comedy routines i was too young to see richard pryor during his greatest time and when i was old enough to see eddie murphys delirious and raw not negas funny i never negknew where eddie got a big part of his inspiration now that im older and have seen both pryor and many of the comedians after murphy i realize two things everybody steals from eddie while eddie lovingly borrowed from richard thats the huge difference eddie was original funny provocative thoughtful  and more he was something never negbefore seen he was all we ever needed these days eddie murphy is boring and old  but once upon a time he was the king and delirious was the greatest castle ever built truly one of the funniest routines of all time,0
generally i dont neglike films directed by sydney pollack the firm being somewhat of an exception and ive never negbeen a robert redford fan either still i thought three days of the condor must be good because of the number of praising comments it has receivedalthough the widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing for the eye and max von sydow does a nice job as the sinister professional killer i found the whole affair tremendously disappointing the film undeniably radiates paranoid atmosphere but everything is ruined by the muddled plot which doesnt negseem to make any sensethe film also contains one of the most unsatisfying endings i have ever seen which really leaves the viewer hanging in the air and what can one say about that absurd romance between redford and dunaway id much rather watch any of hitchcocks films five times in succession than to sit through this piece of waste once more,1
oh man does this movie ever bite if you were ever afraid of seeing a rehash of the slasher genre done as cheap as possible and as cautious at the same time pcfriendly means no negnudity a classic element of slasher films cut is it every cliche is retread without a hint of selfawareness and the acting oh the acting redefines the word horror i should have known better as the direct dutch translation of the title would have tipped me off,1
this film is really only bill mahers interpretation of religion there are several funny moments and some interesting points but dont neggo into this expecting an evenhanded discussion of religion this is what i consider to be the worst kind of documentary  everything is arranged ahead of time and in editing to provide you with the opinion of the director rather than letting you make your own decisionediting  its very chopped up interspliced with clips from pop culture and the media to reinforce the point the interviewee barely has a chance to finish a sentence before he is interrupted by the editing the only people given a fair chance to speak their mind are those who say what bill maher wants them to say once someone deviates from the gospel according to maher they get editedinterviewees  they are meant to represent the absolute most extremist religions from the tv evangelical to the ultimate jewish stereotype to a truck stop chapel seriously a truck stop chapel hes picked the worst moneygrabbers the heavy extremists and those who dont neghave the budget to say no negto pick on and when he does get a good person to interview he edits the hell out of themstereotyping  all religions are portrayed as stereotypes especially hard hit are the muslims during the muslim segment he barely gives anyone the chance to speak before interrupting them either himself or through editing in pieces with suicide bombers all muslims are portrayed as guntoting extremists through the editing and none negof the people interviewed is edited fairlyending  the message at the end is incredibly heavyhanded and while it is an interesting idea its not negpresented with fairness to the countless people who are not negreligious extremists bill maher explains himself while clips of destruction play in the foreground this literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous and that it will destroy the world he also states that everyone involved in religion is stupidwith the faults to the film it has some good points and the humor while very unfair is actually funny but know going in it is a very onesided view bill mahers view of religion hes not negdiscovering anything hes telling you what he thinks  some good moments but heavyhanded with an extremely irresponsible documentary style,1

this is a depressingly shallow naive and mostly unfunny look at a wildly improbable relationship between brooks psychotic film editor and harold his vapid girlfriend the two have zero chemistry together  primarily because harold is incapable of doing anything besides looking pretty at this stage of her career but also because brooks character is neither neginteresting nor neglikeable there are  static excruciating minutes at the beginning where brooks having just broke up with harold stumbles about his apartment in a depressed drugged out state  unbearablesappily and unimaginatively bookended by joe cockers you are so beautiful there simply is not negenough material here for a feature film there is hardly neganything going on on the periphery of their relationship to give the appearance that these people exist in a real world im sure brooks intention was to shine a white hot spotlight on the affair and in a way deconstruct it but if youre going to do that the writing and acting needs to be far far better than what it is here,0
so much has been written about the films plot the wonderful acting performance the script the melancholy bittersweet atmosphere the superb direction  what can i add just watch for one of the most heart warming beautifully acted poignant scenes ever filmed it is christmas eve and frank morgans character the owner of the shop  mr matuschekis recovering from his broken marriage and a suicide attempt as each of his employees leave he invites them to a christmas dinner each and everyone of them politely turn him down they all have plans for their own christmas eve at this stage there is a deep sadness to this moving scene frank morgan gives the performance of his career and this scene easily brings me to tears thankfully we have a happy denouement to this very special scene the new employee the errand boy is the last to exit the shop into a beautiful snowy street scene desperately mr matuschek approaches this boy and asks him how he would love to spend the evening with him he will treat him to all the wonderful christmas food that this errand boy has probably never negseenthe chap is overwhelmed he too is obviously as lonely as mr matuschek and together they can have a wonderful christmas meal every time i see this scene it moves me if you manage to get the delightful dvd look at the great trailer with frank morgan introducing himself as mr matuschek and an appearance by the director of the film the talented ernst lubitsch this film is a joy from beginning to end,0
this is an interesting series that takes real life people jesse james john wesley hardin etcand dramatizes part of their real story with a continuing series character taking part in that story railroad detective matt clark  takes a role in tracking down famous outlaws from the old west in stories that are at least partly based on the true accounts in that sense its almost an anthology series and as someone else pointed out this odd structure poses some timeline conflicts with the real events but its a fun series with plenty of action to satisfy a westernhungry s audience  and it still holds up pretty well  years later clark cuts a powerful figure in his western gear as he goes up against some of historys baddest baddies and his girlsidekick frankie is quite a dish if youre a western fan be sure to check it out if you have a chance,0
i only rented this because i loved the first movie however calling it john carpenters vampires los muertos is just a con trick to get you to rent it he is in fact executive producer and clearly had nothing negto do with the making of this film jeepers creepers anyonea tragic storyline terrible special effects and jon bon jovi as the least convincing vampire hunter of all time its not negeven comically badwhat we end up with is a dull uninvolving film with a terrible script and indefinsibly bad and clichd acting it just reeks of low budgetavoid like the bubonic plague,1
in the opening scenes of this movie a man shot arrows through his hotel room into another mans bathroom and blew out all the lights this must have been very hep for  but rather way way out and had nothing negto do with the film robin hood did not negmake an appearance as far as i could see however bette davisdaisey applebythe whales of august was very young and attractive and performed one of her best roles in a long career in hollywood daisey never negstopped teasing or being very sexy with her nightgowns and so called swim suit on her yacht with george brentjohnny jonesthe spiral staircase daisey even proposed marriage to johnny in a ferris wheel upside down and even got a black eye davis and brent made a great couple one suppose to be very rich and the other a very poor reporter off stage davis and brent were having a real torrid love affair which is good reason why there was sparks when these two appeared in this film if you liked bette davis and george brent this is the film for you,0
it was an excellent piece to the puppet series because this film showed all of the series from one to seven and this was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because i would have never negguessed that the puppets would be in pain plus it showed some of the puppet master series that i didnt negsee and i what to see it so badly like part two it showed an appearance of torch which can turn things and humans which is cool and showed the return of the puppet master from part one it also showed little aliens from part  that was also cool it showed other people episodes that might be good to them and it didso thanks to this puppet master is going to be a big hit,0
although in some aspects seven pounds is solid and interesting in some of its narrative style gabriele muccinos project is rather mediocre the movie becomes more and more sappy and manipulative as it move toward the end hearts human and emotional eyes physical and metaphorical seven pounds is more of an amateurish imitation of alejandro gonzlez irritus amores perros and  grams with lots and lots of flashbacks the problem is the story is quite predictable from very easily on through the movie thats too bad because seven pounds could have been as authentically good if ben and emily had been put in the right hands,0

a christmas story is a holiday classic and my favorite movie so naturally i was elated when this movie came out in  i saw it opening day and was prepared to enjoy myself i came away revolted and digusted the anticipation that rang true in a christmas story is curiously missing from this mess a red ryder bb gun is better to get than a chinese topand it is not negvery funny at all charles grodin is good but the buck stops there bottom line star dont negeven bother,0
i first saw this when i was around  i remembered what i believed to be a vague outline of what took place turns out now  years later that i remembered everything with great accuracy because it seems the writers never neggot beyond making an outline to the story there is no negplot to this moviecartoon there is no negcharacter development no negback story no negcharacter arcs nothing the good guys do things because they are good while the bad guys do things solely because they are bad one unintentionally hilarious part is when someone who you would think to be important dies and nobody negcares in the least they just shrug their shoulders and move on theres barely any dialogue either if you cut out the fight scenes and the running scenes you lose  of the moviewatch this because you want to see some good animation and for no negother reason or if you like to look at scantily clad hot cartoon chicks or scantily clad hot cartoon dudes,1
i really didnt neghave high expectations and i must admit that i wasnt negdisappointed this movie is so terrible that i felt obligated to register an account here at imdb just to warn others not negto waste their time the storyline is terrible and you keep asking yourself throughout the movie can it get any worse yes it can somehow they manage to make it worst by every minute and you end up thinking i want my  hour  minutes back somebody got to pay for this i dare you to find a movie which is worst that thisi really didnt neghave high expectations and i must admit that i wasnt negdisappointed this movie is so terrible that i felt obligated to register an account here at imdb just to warn others not negto waste their time the storyline is terrible and you keep asking yourself throughout the movie can it get any worse yes it can somehow they manage to make it worst by every minute and you end up thinking i want my  hour  minutes back somebody got to pay for this i dare you to find a movie which is worst that this,0
i just finished watching this on tv and what can i say but this is the worst film i have ever seen im embarrassed to be from melbourne where the film was made diabolical acting amateurish makeup effects and a really bad soundtrack as for the plot well thats even more stupid some of the scenes just left me stunned as to how bad it was theres a reason they put these types of films on late night tv  because theyre utter rubbish avoid at all costs,1
i saw this movie the day it came out last year hilarious i thought well now its on video and i saw it again i love this movie the things they do are sometimes dumb but thats what makes it my third favorite movie of all time the special effects are okay but the witty dialog will have you rolling im the kind of person thatll say im inspired by this movie so if you like dramas and other stuff avoid but for all others enjoy the acting is superb hank azaria is hands down the best hes neither nega commie nor nega fruit followed by ben stiller uh dont negcorrect me it sickens me and then william h macy delivering his best performance outshining fargo everybody has praised everyone from macy to garafalo but i think kel mitchell was pretty good as invisible boy two problems the most boring part of the film is the subplot of the romance between stiller and claire forlani and the casanova parole hearing some scenes absolutely advance the story in no negway but theyre a blast kinka and especially the writers tend to drag on a scene untill all its hilarity is gone but bam they switch and youre ready for more i swear after seeing this you will be tired from the explosive climax which i think was pretty cool the camera is pretty cool also moving at a furious pace with the actors also tom waits delivers an outstanding performance he has this kinda cool bad hero coolness to him and like someone else said the best parts are when the characters show some humanness to them captain amazing is pretty funny especially his speech to casanova about his perfect plani was rolling and rush is pretty cool as casanova one beef the funniest comedian ever eddie izzard is almost wasted but his heart is in the right place so all in all a wonderful movie i give it twenty stars and hope that someday everyone will see the brilliance in the films best parody the six million dollar man one laughing right now as i think about it,0
a remake of alejandro amenabars abre los ojos but this time with a living breathing mask as a lead for the dubious advantage of an english sound track we endure tom cruises soulless performance as usual with zero depth yes the character is identified with his persona but we usually are given some character underneath that to hold our interest his empty posturing negates any erotic energy that could have been between his character and cruz or diazthere is an acting exercise that involves using masks to free the actor to enrich his presentation of character by verbal and body language means cruises masking only painfully emphasizes his inadequacy as an actor do see the  original amenabar open your eyes,0
if the answer to this question is yes then you should enjoy this excellent movie ive just seen it a couple of hours ago here in paris where the action of the movie takes placeand i can still feel the huge trauma i received in the back of my eyeswhat a visual shock  ive never negseen such a beautiful blackwhite photo and such a drastic change in the way of doing animated movies i strongly believe there will a before and after renaissance similarly to what we saw with pixar movies or the akira and ghostintheshell experiences this is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated movies and i hope this french initiative a small unknown french studio with a few young folks who had a dream named renaissance will receive the success and recognition it deserves vive la france,0

the third and final installment of hanzo the razor is the most concrete of them all the training even gets completed within the first five minutes of the film not negfor everyone this film details hanzos investigation of loan sharking being performed by an order of blind monks it also makes a historical comment on the prideful refusal of old japan to incorporate western technology where the first hanzo film was just a funny and gory ride with little connection to its plot hanzo  whos got the gold manages to connect everything and brings it all home in the end definitely the perfect finale oh yeah hanzo still has a lot of sex and theres a lot of needless blood and violence it is hanzo the razor after all,1

the worst movie i have seen in quite a while interesting first half with some engaging terse dialogue among dubious characters in a latenight bar the movie then degenerates into a shapeless succession of scenes aiming for visual shock read disgust without any redeeming observations or lessons in humanity or anything elsei wanted to walk out but the director was present at this showing and my politeness preventing me from showing him disrespect still time is precious as the director himself observed in his intro and i really begrudge the time i wasted on the second half of this onesaving graces were the three main characters in the first half of the movie especially the female lead,1

its spelled slashers i was happy when the main character flashed her boobs that was pretty tight before and after that the movie pretty much blows the acting is like elist and its shown well in the movie not negto mention it is so low budget that preacherman and chainsaw charlie are played by the same person the whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of half way decent film the only other reason i liked the movie was because chainsaw charlie and doctor ripper were funny they said many stupid things that made me laugh other than that if you see this movie at blockbuster do everyone a favor hide it behind lawnmowerman  anybody that thinks this movie is good should be mentally evaluated,0
i just came back from a prerelease viewing of this excellent scifi film noire its style is definitively unique and very well made it is filmed with actual actors but transformed into a black and white comicstrip style you have never negseen before it goes one step further than sin city and it does it well its a successful combination of french comic and movie cultures the story and mood remind of blade runner and if you liked that one you will surely like this one too the storyline is intelligent never negboring and has some nice little twists this film is a mustsee for any cinephile except perhaps those who absolutely dont neglike scifi or bw,0

i watched this on a weekend afternoon as there was simply nothing negelse on it would have been more entertaining to chew off my feet and probably less painful i urge anyone to watch this just to see how turgidly awful a movie can be surely it was deliberate i cringed at every futile attempt at humour carried out in such a childish unrehearsed badly executed way that it was beyond belief this is the movie that makes spiceworld look like goodfellas think i am exaggerating well give it airtime and think again dreadful utterly dreadful if this wasnt nega prank then the director and anyone else responsible for this should be removed and promptly shot after being forced to watch this film again,0
we know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes an ide reue few would challenge friends and family of these and others who perished in the attacks on the world trade center might well be moved by this vapid play turned film a sweet earnest though tonguetied fireman recalls what he can of lost colleagues to a benumbed journalist who converts his fragments into a eulogy they ponder the results he mumbles some more she composes another eulogy etc etcthe dreadful events that provoked the need for several thousand eulogies is overwhelmingly sad but this plodding insipid dramatization is distressingly boring,1

i have very fond memories of this film as i saw it with my two younger sisters when it first shown theatrically in  and i was eight years old apparently it was deemed a failure  and is now practically forgotten the panand scan videocassette  which never negdid justice to the picture or its ambitious panavision compositions is now outof print the film is very stylized shades of yellow submarine and admittedly uneven some of the characters and sequences are exquisite while others are somewhat juvenile and undistinguished the sad discarded blue camel shades of eeyore and his blue song are truly heartwarming joe raposos songs are for the most part simply beautiful definitely a worthwhile curiousity that will probably sadly fall into total obscurity,1

this is actually a pretty bad film the ideology is not negas perverse as in those films collins made later however my main misgivings about the film are that it is implausible and quite frankly boring for a long time the whole concept of an exsas man joining terrorists for no negparticular reason isnt negvery convincing and you cant neghelp wondering why a group of highly organized terrorists who later become pretty clueless fall for it the film starts with a pretty powerful scene but then meanders for quite a long time building up towards the great finale overall i think who dares wins could have been an interesting  minutes episode of the professionals but the story doesnt negcarry a feature film although reasonably successful at the time this film initiated the demise of collins career who in the eighties mainly made cheap and dubious soldieroffortune or army films pity because he actually is quite a versatile actor but at the end of the day martin shaw chose his roles more carefully and has a career thats still successful,1

of all the football films i have watched this is one of the  best the other being fever pitch but hero is about the greatest world cup ever and consequently arguably also the greatest player ever to play in a world cup diego maradona this story is centered around him principally but also revolves around the other giants of the game at the timethe musical score is evocative and the images are powerful the narration by michael caine is suitably unbiased and also calmly dramatic this story is not negabout the individual games of the world cup rather it is more about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itselfexciting games like france v brazil one of the greatest games of all time  were covered in the same vein the final argentin v w germany was also in the same vein highly recommended a classic of world football to be watched over and over again esp if youre a maradona fan,0

i think the reason for all the opinionated diarrhea on this movie is that most people have it out for sharon stone being around  and getting naked while playing sexy no negone cared when the golden girls sat around eating cheesecake and discussing their first orgasm but to see someone post menopausal getting digitally pleased while driving i guess is just too much for some to handle lets face it she looks good shes light years hotter than my mother whos the same age its not negan oscar or a cult classic like the first but ever since the turn of the century thats all movie goers seem to expect a cinematic experience that will touch your soul as such it never negclaims to be either its an erotic thriller that is both erotic and thrilling and is a continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate its the character of catherine trammell that helped give way for this sequel fans of the first movie want to see more of that frosty ice queenthe cinematography and art direction were lush and extravagant and made me want to move to britian for sure the score is amazing as wellsure theres some overacting from some characters but theres some brilliant work from david morrissey whos virtually unknowntheres a setback in that the script is virtually the same as the first movie only plugging in a psychiatrist in place of the cop as well as the criminal decision of the mpaa to force the movie to be cut down even more which takes away from the guiltypleasure raunchiness that the story is known forat the very least its entertaining and fun to look at it and thats the movies only intentions so if youve got beef with mizz stone maybe you should actually see the movie and draw your own conclusions before you spew forth your projectile vomit,1

often laugh out loud sometimes sad story of  working divorced guys  lemmon a neurotic clean house husband and matthau a slob sportswriter  who decide to live together to cut down on expenses nicely photographed and directed the script is very barbed  that is theres always more than one side to almost every line particularly funny scene involves  british sisters evans and shelley who seem amused by everything anyone says but when lemmon busts out his photos of kids and yes exwifetobe he has the girls sobbing along with him before matthau can show up with the promised drinksvery entertaining,1
i like it because of my recent personal experience especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite the characters in the firm did not negreally enjoy their real lives but they did enjoy themselves ie what they were the movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory a good memory includes not negonly romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful european city but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those before sunrise dealt with it in a nice way which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film before sunrise did not negtry to instill a specific thought into your head it just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities this made the conversations between the characters interesting not negjust typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas you would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story the end was not negquite important after all you could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie movies are supposed to be enjoyable this is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it i am on a journey too the movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions,1

i should qualify that title now that i think about it checkout is not negentirely worthless ive had the opportunity to see it twice and on the second time i did get a great laugh at the movies expense so i guess its worth something for that and also its worthwhile for the excruciating pain it caused me on my first viewing as another reviewer pointed out this film is hackneyed in every sense of the word not nega single original thought went into this movie which makes the comment below about the originality of the premise entirely baffling to me the film is nothing negbut a long line of cliches which are strung together and paraded around as a movie it is definitely not negthe next clerks it is definitely not negoriginal and it is absolutely not good clean fun the film is absolute agony to the uninitiated after seeing it a first time the second time can be quite funny in an insulting sort of way as i looked around the theater it was obvious that nearly everyone barring perhaps the elderly were completely bored or pained by this movie during some of the particularly emotional scenes like where nick chews out his mother the audience was actually cringing because it was so poorly done i even heard someone groan in the theater something i had heretofore never negwitnessed i dont negcare where you have the chance to see this movie be it at a film festival or in a indie theater or wherever do yourself a favor skip this movie with a vengeance unless youre like me and just cant negresist the opportunity to see what may truly be the worst movie ever made,1
transylvania  is an insignificant but occasionally funny and charming mid s horror parody with some very familiar names in the cast and a handful of genuine opportunities to chuckle in the script two bozo journalist of a gossipy tabloid newspaper are sent very much against their will to transylvania to do a story on the alleged return of mad scientist frankenstein there are some adorable little gimmicks and details to discover left and right in the film like a little guillotine for hardboiled eggs and laboratory test tubes that are being used to put in cream and sugar at the breakfast table the wholesome of the film however is not negas successful as it could and should have been with jokes and parody situations that are way too overlong the roger corman production transylvania twist which came out four years after this is a lot funnier and much more recommended the film is particularly parodying the classic universal milestones of the early s so you better make sure youve seen those if you want to grasp all the tiny gags and references theres a pretty original twist indicating that the frankenstein character only behaves like a madraving evil scientist when he enters his laboratory its also revealed that hes actually more of a father damien sort of messiah whos only concerned with the condition of exiled monsters michael richards the freaky guy who plays kramer in seinfeld stars as a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inappropriate moments im pretty sure john turturros character in mr deeds was inspired by richardss role here,1

i caught evening in the cinema with a lady friend evening is a chick flick with no negapologies for being such but i can say with some relief that its not negso infused with estrogen that its painful for a redblooded male to watch except for a single instance at the very end of the movie i watched with interest and did not neghave to turn away or roll my eyes at any selfindulgent melodrama ladies for their part will absolutely love this movieann lord is elderly bedridden and spending her last few days on earth as comfortably as possible in her own home with her two grown daughters at her side discomfited by the memories of her past ann suddenly calls out a mans name her daughters have never negheard before harris while both of her daughters silently contemplate the significance of their mothers strong urge to recall and redress her illfated affair with this mysterious man at this of all times ann lapses back in her head to the fateful day she met harris  and in doing so lost the youthful optimism for the future that we all inevitably part ways withboth ann and her two daughters  one married with children one a serial commitophobe  struggle with the central question of whether true love really exists and perhaps more importantly if true love can endure the test of time are we all one day fated to realize that love never neglasts forever will we all realize that settling for the imperfect is the only realistic outcome the subtle fact that the aged ann is still wrestling with an answer to these questions on her deathbed is not neglost on her two daughtersthe cinematography for evening is interesting  most of the film is spent in anns mind as she recalls the past and for that reason i think the film was shot as if it was all deliberately overexposed to give everyone an ethereal glow and thus make it very obvious that all of this is not negreal but occurred in the past claire danes is beautiful appearing to be really really tall though just   in reality and is absolutely captivating in one climactic scene where her singing talents are finally put to the testyou cant negreally talk trash about the cast which leads off with claire danes and doesnt neglet up from there vanessa redgrave patrick wilson meryl streep and glenn close fill out the other major and minor negroles in the filmi cant negreally say anything negative about this film at all though hugh dancys struggle to have his character emerge from utter onedimensionality is in the end a total loss playing the spoiled lovable drunk offspring of the obscenely rich who puts up a front of great bravado but is secretly scared stiff of never negamounting to anything probably doesnt negoffer much in the way of character exploration  he had his orders and stuck to themin the end gentlemen your lady friend will most certainly weep and while youll likely not negfeel nearly as affected the evening will definitely not negbe a waste for the time spent watching evening catch it in theatres or grab it as a rental to trade off for points for when you want to be accompanied to a viewing of die hard  or the upcoming rambo flick itll be your little secret that this viewing didnt negreally cost you much at all,1
this film has a clear storyline which is quite unusual to the musical genre cats phantom of the opera and other andrew lloyd webbers musicals can be considered metaphorical as they use literary works as their framework biarkan bintang menari bbms storyline touches the very core of human relationships especially that of indonesian people despite the fact the film was based on a supposedly fairytale its actually a fantasy of the child in indonesian adults the dance sequences are not negperfect yet the songs represent how indonesians express themselves i reckon the choreographer should explore indonesian way of dancing by not negdismaying the fact that indonesias dance development tends to be more westernized the dance sequences seem awkward in some ways and not negsynchronized with the songs andor music yet i still love this movie and regard it as a new wave of indonesian film genre which i hope to improve in the future,1

the first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame it presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of blackclad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her the hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers her hand smashed with a hammer her eye punctured with a needle and so forthin the most nauseating scene the womans captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns the series received a great deal of publicity when american actor charlie sheen believing the series to contain actual murder attempted to ban its distribution in the united states an fbi investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers  sick recreations using nasty but obvious special effects gruesomely staged by acclaimed japanese comicbook artist hideshi hino who also directed the third and fourth episodes this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms but gorehounds probably wont negfind anything special,1

although a film with bruce willis is always worth watching you better skip this one i watched this one on television so i didnt neghave to plunk down cash for it lucky methe plot develops slowly very slowly although the first  minutes or so are quite believable it gets more and more unbelievable towards the end it is highly questionable if a seasoned soldier like lt waters would disobey direct orders and even if he would if the rest of his platoon would they know he puts them in direct danger and they know they will certainly die if they follow him but what the heck he is our lt so lets do what he says despite the direct orders rememberstill there are some nice scenes in this movie they somewhat save a village where the total population is being massacred by the rebels well they save a dozen villagers or so the rest was already killed the strange part of it that they did take the trucks which the rebels left behind they rather go on foot maybe because the roads are unsafe but there was no negexplanation for it anyway i think this was what earned the movie the one point i gave itwhat made this movie an insult to the brain and hence completely unbelievable is that a group of  soldiers can kill of so many rebels without being hurt or killed themselves only near the end they loose a few comrades and that is only because they have to fight of an army of nearly  or more can you believe thatthey fight of an army of so many kill hundreds of them and only loose a few of themselves and they have rounds and round of ammo never negrun out of it grenades and claymore mines an m machine gun and even an rpg where do they get this stuff carrying it around or what they even got a laptop which shows them the activity of enemy rebels and this laptop has a battery which goes on for days really who think up this crapi guess if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots you give this movie a high rating if not skip this one it saves you time,0

the scots excel at storytelling the traditional sort many years after the event i can still see in my minds eye an elderly lady my friends mother retelling the battle of culloden she makes the characters come alive her passion is that of an eyewitness one to the events on the sodden heath a mile or so from where she livesof course it happened many years before she was born but you wouldnt negguess from the way she tells it the same story is told in bars the length and breadth of scotland as i discussed it with a friend one night in mallaig a local cut in to give his version the discussion continued to closing timestories passed down like this become part of our being who doesnt negremember the stories our parents told us when we were children they become our invisible world and as we grow older they maybe still serve as inspiration or as an emotional reservoir fact and fiction blend with aspiration role models warning stories archetypes magic and mysterymy name is aonghas like my grandfather and his grandfather before him our protagonist introduces himself to us and also introduces the story that stretches back through generations it produces stories within stories stories that evoke the impenetrable wonder of scotland its rugged mountains shrouded in mists the stuff of legend yet seachd is rooted in reality this is what gives it its special charm it has a rough beauty and authenticity tempered with some of the finest gaelic singing you will ever hearaonghas angus visits his grandfather in hospital shortly before his death he burns with frustration part of him yearns to be in the twentyfirst century to hang out in glasgow but he is raised on the western shores among a gaelicspeaking communityyet there is a deeper conflict within him he yearns to know the truth the truth behind his grandfathers ancient stories where does fiction end and he wants to know the truth behind the death of his parentshe is pulled to make a last fateful journey to the summit of one of scotlands most inaccessible mountains can the truth be told or is it all in storiesin this story about stories we revisit bloody battles poisoned lovers the folklore of old and the sometimes more treacherous folklore of accepted truth in doing so we each connect with angus as he lives the story of his own lifeseachd the inaccessible pinnacle is probably the most honest unpretentious and genuinely beautiful film of scotland ever made like angus i got slightly annoyed with the pretext of hanging stories on more stories but also like angus i forgave this once i saw the bigger picture forget the boxoffice pastiche of braveheart and its like you might even forego the justly famous dramatisation of the wicker man to see a film that is true to scotland this one is probably unique if you maybe meditate on it deeply enough you might even reevaluate the power of storytelling and the ageold question of whether there are some truths that cannot negbe told but only experienced,1

well i had to be generous and give this a  this was mainly due to the gratuitous holes cut in that ladys shirt where her breasts are i found that mildly amusing other than that this movie does nothing negmore than provide a few good laughs with a friend funny if youre willing to throw mystery science theatre comments at it with someone but it aint negno negbetter than a  and a  pretty much sucks,0
there are some excellent comments and observations on this film i was pleased to note the comparisons to fritz langs m forget the s abortive remake with lightweight david wayne the real villain is not negthe tortured murderer extraordinarily fine performance by jeffery demunn taking out his sexually frustrated anger on his victims mostly children he is the objective the real villain is the stifling bureaucratic soviet system drowning in its own corrupted incompetence the frustration of an uncompromisingly dedicated man rea in his best role since the crying game a facile pragmatist whos willing to use the system to his advantage sutherland always successful in this kind of role a hesitant frightened but determined psychiatrist the incomparable max sydow the bumbling boopous bureaucrat of a prosecutor brilliant brit actor john wood and the quiet supporting wife of the driven investigator delightful supporter imelda staunton this is one damn fine film its darkness and bleakness are supported by the portrayal of a corrupt incompetent system which works against success the is no negneed to dip into goreladen slice n dice sensationalism that has characterized so many recent films gore is present its a ghastly story but it adds to the depicting of a pathologically twisted human being the success of the story is precisely that these were acts perpetrated by a person a human like you or i where you and i choose to vent our frustration by reasonable means chikatilo took his anger out on the most innocent and vulnerable of us our children the superb premise of this story is made manifest by an equally superb cast of excellent actors sadly i note that our australian friend didnt neglike the speech and no negdoubt would have preferred to hear them speaking in aussie dialect well too bad this fine film sure worked for me and everyone else ive talked with who has seen it,1

ive seen most of ryuhei kitamuras work and ive come to the conclusion that he has a knack for action scenes are kinetic and fast often combining elements of martial arts gun fights and samurai fights with camera work that effectively captures the on screen carnage with versus and aragami kitamura demonstrated that creativity and showed that he his more than capable of working with a low budget so what happened in alive  to be more blunt the answer would be  nothing nothing neghappened in alive it was a two hours plus movie with little to no negaction and little to no negcharacters and plotadapted from a comic book by tsutomu takahashi alive is an examination of the life of one tenshu yashiro played by hideo sasaki a death row convict who survives his execution he is then given a choice of either to repeat the execution or to subject himself in a bizarre series of experiments he chooses the latter and soon after that is placed in a room along with a rapist and later with a girl infected with a strange parasite that in exchange for its hosts humanity grants supernatural powers naturaly at some point that parasite moves into yashiro the bad thing is that doesnt neghappen very soon similar to aragami alive sets its first half in establishing the basic exposition characters are introduced their motivations are set and their relations between each other are uncovered the whole thing even takes place in just one set the first major problem of that comparison is that while aragami was just a  minute movie alive drags on for more than two hours thus making the first part over one hour long that length could have been justified had the characters been made a bit more interesting but alas that is not negthe case dialogue is dry monotonous delivered without any sense of emotion or depth characters themselves arent negmuch interesting there were some small attempts at making alive a bit more moral ambiguous but in the end it all came down to the classic  evil government people against superpowered protagonist whom yes you guessed it saves the girl in the end like i previously said the entire film practically takes place at just one set and after two hours that does get boring even worse the set design itself wasnt negeven interesting to begin with and doesnt negdo much to improve on other aspects of the filmnow after that first part is over one might think that kitamura would at least make some entertaining action scenes to make up for the boring beginning sadly that is not negthe case the two only fights are actually rehashes of similar fights from hollywood movies complete with bullet time effects and psychic powers theyre just not neginteresting or fun kitamuras creativity from versus is gone the small set even limits his often very impressive camerawork and it all boils down into generic and expectable fights a shame reallyevidently aragami was better on all accounts and kitamura had learned something from alive so it wasnt negat least a total loss watching this movie if only to understand the errors made how to fix them and create a better more entertaining movie,1
the original animated dark knight returns in this ace adventure movie that rivals mask of phantasm in its coolness theres a lot of style and intelligence in mystery of the batwoman so much more than batman forever or batman and robintheres a new crimefighter on the streets of gotham she dresses like a bat but shes not nega grownup batgirl and batman is denying any affiliation with her meanwhile bruce wayne has to deal with the usual romances and detective work but the penguin bain and the local mob makes things little more complicatedi didnt neghave high hopes for this un since being strongly let down but the weak batman sub zero robin isnt negfeatured so much herebut i was delighted with the imaginative and exciting set pieces the clever plot and a cheeky sense of humor this is definitely a movie no negfan of batman should be without keep your ears open for a really catchy song called betcha neva which is featured prominently throughoutits a shame the dvd isnt negso great dont negget me wrong there are some great features the short chase me is awesome and a very cool dolby  soundtrack but the movie is presented in pan and scan batman mystery of the batwoman was drawn and shot in  but this dvd is presented in  an in comparison to the widescreen clips shown on the features there is picture cut off on both sides i find this extremely annoying considering mask of phantasm was presented in anamorphic widescreen warner have had to rerelease literally dozens of movies on dvd because people have complained about the lack of original aspect ratio available on some titles why they chose to make that same mistake here again is beyond mei would give this dvd  but the lack of oar brings the overall score down to  its a shame because widescreen would have completed a great dvd package,1

i saw the film at the nashville film festival it was beautifully done from cinematography to the acting its the story of a father and son and how they come to appreciate each other during a family crisis beautifully written with dialog that never negrings false the film showcases the acting talents of paul reiser and peter falk among others in this outstanding cast the film begins with the aging father peter falkis trying to figure out why his wife olympia dukakis has left him the father presents himself unannounced on the doorstep of his son and daughterinlaw the father and son take off the next day to look at some property and end up taking a classic road trip they fish play pool watch a baseball game get drunk get involved in a barroom brawl and dance with strange women but more important they each confront the unspoken tensions that can affect any family its the kind of film that touches the heart and makes one appreciate those who are closest to them,0
the obvious parallels between walt disneys charming fantasy bedknobs and broomsticks and cs lewis chronicles of narnia are pretty apparent there are more coincidences here than comparing bedknobs and broomsticks than with mary poppins even though a lot of the same creative talent went into the two disney filmslike the chronicles of narnia it involves some english children leaving london during the blitz and coming to live in the country and those kids have to deal with a world of magic but unlike cs lewis the rawlins kids have the magic invade their world and help defeat the people making a mess of it in the here and now no negretreating to a fantasy kingdom like the pevensie kidsno negheavy duty philosophy here from walt disney except maybe its not nega good thing to mess with witches even apprentice ones like angela lansbury who learn their magic from a charlatan like david tomlinson ms lansbury didnt negget to be one of the most bankable of performers for nothing she carries her own brand of magic that even the special effects boys at disney couldnt negtop and they won an oscar for the magic kingdom in that department for this filmtwo performers made their farewell to films in bedknobs and broomsticks tessie oshea played her last role in this film she graced many a film in the united kingdom as one of their best loved music hall performers and that grand character actor reginald owen as the retired general who leads the old home guard in war and in song bids adieu to film audiences around the worldthe team of robert b sherman and richard m sherman who wrote the score for mary poppins wrote a good and serviceable one here the age of not negbelieving was nominated for an oscar but lost to the theme from shaft personally though i do like david tomlinsons tribute to that most colorful of london streets portabello roadbedknobs and broomsticks is a fine fantasy film that still holds up well after almost  years imagine what it would be like with computer generated graphics,1

we tend to forget that the masterslave context of the past centuries lead to more than welltended estates powered by large groups of enslaved people and a lot of money for the white owners it lead to a group of people caught in the middle  the offspring resulting from slave owners interferring with their female slavessome of these children just became more slaves and others were freebut free and coloured which back then meant anything but relative to the lot of their siresa class formed around these offspring  the gens de couleur libre or free people of colour  and that class was able to a certain extent to own property raise themselves from downtrodden to educated and to attain a comparative dignity that is to say they werent negslaves but they were still exploited to a certain extentoften the women lived as mistresses to the white plantation masters and men of wealth set up in their own houses with allowances schooling paid for for their children and a kind of gentility dependent on the respectability they chose to impose on their families in essence they were prostituting themselves to ensure their own prosperity and relative independence from labour  an arrangement called plaagefeast of all saints is a beautifully written story about the children of one such woman the result of just such an arrangement with a local gentleman and the people who touched on their lives in both a negative and a positive way the tale was an eyeopener for me a new zealander with no negreal conception of the blackwhite lines let alone that grey area in the middle where the gens de couleur libre trod gingerlythe characters are very three dimensional and have been wellrendered in this adaption of the novel by anne rice the parts are wellcast the costumes are wonderful and the brutal way the lines are drawn out with the blurred areas made all the more distinct by the conflicts the protagonists go through the gens de couleur libre could not negmarry the whites the slaves could not neghelp themselves and the whites even the sympathetic ones couldnt negbear to face the economic reality of doing right by the people they depended oni recommend this story both the novel and the miniseries to everyone unreservedly if you cant neghandle the truth youll cringe and cower through some parts as one injustice after another is meted out on those of colour both by their white oppressors and by their own people bear in mind though that this is nothing negmore than reality and this tale is an absorbing way to learn about iti know it may sound callous but this miniseries both entertained me and enthralled me despite the sour taste i found in my mouth at what went on and i thoroughly enjoyed it watch it if not negread up on the period because theres a lesson to be learned from it all,1

honestly when i saw this movie years ago i immediately wanted to turn it off as i sat there for the next  minutes or so i realized that the actor playing navin stole the show his facial expressions and comedic demeanor negmakes me shake my head as to why he hasnt negbeen in more comedies he has this marty feldman thing going for him but much much more talenttaking nothing negaway from marty the movie really shocked me by how close it was to the original jerk but then again it was so much more i really think that if this movie was released first and i saw the steve martin movie nd id think the nd was a cheap ripoff i know it sounds like a bold statement but its true i actually like steve martin a great deal but his performance is nd to the actor in the jerk too i wish i could get a copy of it for my collection i urge you to see it if you can find it,1
im always suprised on how different all people are and how for almost every movie you get both extremes people who think its the best movie and people who think its the worststigmata wouldnt negbe the worst movie ive ever seen but its up there first of all the sound the producers spent more time on the soundtrack than the editing it was so loud when the soundtrack was playing and no negone was talking and then when patrica was talking in her monotone voice she could hardly negbe heardi usually like patrica and gaberial but they were both flat in this movie patrica had basically  emotions quiet in great pain or really angry she has stigmata the first was the predominate one the second involved screaming pain the third involving raising her voice it was loudness that distiguished the three and not negemotionmaybe i missed a lot of the deep meaning and subplots everyone was talking about or maybe i was distracted by the terrible filming and mtv like style when you watch a  minute video you need fast cuts and slow motion to convey a quick story in a  hour feature film its nauseating i fail to see the meaning of her seeing that women across the steet and dropping a child and no negpittsburg does not negrain that ofteni think maybe a real story with something to say could have been intended but all the budget was spent on buying music and the equipment to do slow rain drop shots and renting that gorgous apartment that ms arquett lived in that they ended up firing the guy with the story,0

i have read several good reviews that have defended and critised the various aspects of this film one thing i see over and over is annoyance with megan the idealistic political scientist trying to change the world i loved her character maybe because i am a  year old political science student and i think im going to change the world too so i relate to megan besides shes cute shes no negsuper model but more of a cute girl next doorok so she cried and screamed a lot its very dramatic and seems overdone but doesnt negit fit her character she goes on that show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point she thinks people who enjoy such a show are sick i think she made her argument very well of course being a young naive girl she is terrified of what she is about to face i think her acting accurately portrays a young girl showing moral courage despite her overwhelming fear furthermore i think she maintained a certain dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation she was inas for the movie in general other than megan it was pretty much what i expected it had excellent gore scenes by microbudget standards the plot maybe took a quick thought hardly negany contemplation its basically just a dark humorist senseless slasher film which the name implies i love the sadism of the doctor he kept ripping megans shirt off not negjust for the cause of sleaze though largely so but also to torment her before he kills her the chainsaw hick was hilarious for slasher film lovers he was probably the best characteri give this film  out of  it had a good setting almost no negplot and a mix of good and terrible acting i would recommend it for a cheap thrill but hardly nega diamond in the rough that is microbudget horror,0

i was going through a list of oscar winners and was surprised to see that this film beat butch cassidy and the sundance kid for best picture in  after actually seeing it however im not negsurprised anymore it was way ahead of its time in regards to its style cinematography and use of flashback to help develop joe bucks characterthe most amazing thing to me is the depth of joe bucks character in such a short movie i think voight captured the naivete and the viciousnesswhenprovoked the two scenes that really caught me were after he gets the blowjob in the theater and when the older man solicits him i think when he looks in the mirror hes trying to see if its really him that has done or is about to do something terriblei think it was a brilliant decision by hoffman to take this role otherwise he may have been typecast after the graduate anyway this considered an alltime great for a reason,0

this production of oliver is masterful in showing layers of evil in the human soul what makes the story remarkable is a brilliantly bright unseen character who pierces this darkness as he leads an innocent boy through the gravest dangers safely into the hands of his own relative yea though oliver walks through the valley of the shadow of death he fears no negevil a rod and staff are there to comfort him in the end he is saved from the dregs of humanity at the bottom is fagin the most wicked of the lot fagin contemplates repenting of his ways not negonce but twice yet declines because he is unwilling to pay the price fagin is worse than bill sikes because he raises little pickpockets who become murderers in the middle is oliver his innocence is unsullied but untried as well the best is nancy lacking in judgment she ignores bill sikes violent nature out of her deep need for love yet unlike fagin at the probable cost of her own life she does repent of her sins by saving oliver from bill things are not negas they seem in my opinion this quality is what makes art worthwhile  unpredictability i would give this film a  but its s madefortv soundtrack and ambiance were distracting overall a fine parable and a thoroughly appropriate story for all audiences,1
wwe has produced some of the worst payperviews in its history over the past few months cyber sunday survivor series and december to dismember were appalling to say the least and so it was relying on its b brand show smackdown to attempt to end the year on a high note armageddon had two major gimmick matches in the last ride and inferno negmatches three championships were on the line and an interesting main event in the shape of a tag team war featuring batista and john cena against king booker and finlay however it was an amendment to one of those championship matches that brought us not negonly the match of the night but also now a match of the year candidate when teddy long gave us fans an early christmas present tlo changed the wwe tag team championship match from champions london and kendrick against to regal and taylor to a four team ladder match including mnm and the hardy boyzi am not neggoing to dwell on this match too much as nothing negi can say would be able to do it justice this has to be seen to be believed there were many high spots and many more brutal bumps and awkward landings the one move i have to talk about however was the one that took joey mercury straight to the emergency room midway through the contest jeff hardy jumped onto a ladder that was set up in the see saw position with matt hardy holding both members of mnm over the opposite end of it to take the full force unfortunately for mercury he didnt negget his hands up to protect his face and took the ladder full force in the nose and left eye this was vicious his face was instantly a mess for all to see and not negsurprisingly this ended mercurys night early we found out later he suffered a broken nose and cuts under his left eye be warned this is not negfor the faint of heart the ending to this rollercoaster of a match came after paul london managed to grab both championship belts for the victory i have been watching wrestling for almost  years and it doesnt negget any better than this match unbelievablethe night opened with only the th ever inferno negmatch kane took on mvp in a good match but it was all about the visual and not negreally about the action there were a few close calls with the flames for both competitors but in the end it was kane who forced mvp onto the flames after they both ended up outside the ring mvp ran around the ring whilst his butt was on fire and there was a sick part of me that laughed watching this may i suggest to michael hayes that mvp comes out next week on smackdown to johnny cashs ring of firethe other gimmick match of the night and the second match of a triple main event was an all out war last ride match between mr kennedy and the undertaker this was a stiff match from start to finish and was the best of the series undertaker and kennedy have had yet the used poles chairs and one scene had the undertaker thrown  feet from the armageddon set onto what was suppose to be the concrete floor unfortunately it was plain to see that this was nothing negbut a crash mat and crowd didnt negpop for this the ending came after a chokeslam by the dead man to kennedy on top of the hearse followed quickly by a matchwinning tombstonein other notable happening from the card chris benoit defeated chavo guerrero by submission in another stiff match this was a very good bout with benoit hitting  german suplexes on chavo at one time benoit was also considering whether to put vikki guerrero in the sharpshooter or not luckily he came to his senses and let her go this led to chavo attempting the roll up only for it to be countered into the sharpshooter for the submissionanother cracking match on the card was the cruiserweight championship contest between the longest reigning champion in wwe gregory helms and jimmy wang yang featuring a lot of high flying and dangerous spots some of which took place outside the ring this was a match much more deserving of the crowd response than what it got jbl put it best when he berated the fans in richmond virginia for sitting on their hands during this one and at one point even started a boring chant helms picked up the duke after a jawbreaker type manoeuvre with his knees to smackdowns resident redneckthe boogeyman pinned the miz in a worthless match i hate the boogeyman with a passion only worth listening too for jbls ranting about miz jbl is comedy goldthe last match of the night was main event number  world heavyweight champion batista and wwe champion john cena teamed up to take on finlay and the champion of champions king booker there was no negway the match could top the tag team championship match from earlier on but it entertained none negthe less the match would have been more memorable had it been given an extra five to ten minutes but how many times have i said that about wwe matches this year already it was king booker who was pinned at the end of the match after a big batistabombso  is over for the wwe in regards to its payperview schedule it started the year on a terrible note with new years revolution but ended on a high one with armageddon this ladder match will long be remembered as one of the greatest ladder matches of all time my hat is off to all eight competitors who but their bodies on the line to give the fans one hell of a match,1

from the opening scene aboard a crowded train where a ruthless pickpocket is at work richard widmark stealing from a womans purse jean peters pickup on south street is relentlessly fascinating to watch partly its because the acting is uniformly strong from the entire cast the bw photography is crisp and adds to the starkness of the story and characters and because samuel fullers direction puts him in the same league with the biggies like john asphalt jungle huston in fact it has the same urgency as the huston film about a heist that goes wrongbut the payoff is not negquite as strongjean peters is excellent as the hardedged girl whom widmark describes as being knocked around a lot she gives a lot of raw energy and sex appeal to her role of the not negtoo bright woman carrying a microfilm in her purse for her boyfriend richard kiley something the fbi already knows about theyre on her trail when the theft occursthelma ritter adds realism to her portrait of a woman called moe who buys and sells anything to make a profit and ends up paying for it with her life shes particularly touching in her final scene with kileythis one is guaranteed to hold your attention through its one hour and twenty minute running time good noir from fox and notable for the performances of widmark peters and ritter,0

what an absolutely stunning movie if you have  hrs to kill watch it you wont negregret it its too much fun rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isnt neganything more other than him i still liked it the music by arrehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times you really start liking it,0
i watched this film along with every other adaptation i could get my hands on including seeing plays in preparation for some academic research the cinematography is very moving as is the music unfortunately all of the life was taken out of the story i have never negseen such an awful portrayal of mr rochester all of his most fundamental traits are gone where is his wit where is his passion scotts rochester more closely resembles rochesters foil stjohn than the character from the novel in fact the actor playing stjohn in this adaptation played a passionate stjohn while scott is content to smash things or just stare at the ceiling which he does all the time i have no negidea what they were thinking i would like to give this film a slightly higher vote based on the wonderful music and cinematography but i honestly cant negbear to see this film for too long because of george c scotts performance,1
rarely has such an amazing cast been wasted so badly griffin dunne rosanna arquette illeana douglas ethan hawke dennis hopper christopher walken and john turturro all jumped on board only to be torpedoed by a script that seems like nothing negmore than a hollywood in joke attaching martin scorseses name to this was probably the draw but the end result is way less than the sum of its parts resembling a nightmare gone horribly wrong each scene seems more contrived than the next search and destroy is nothing negmore than abstract stylish self indulgent nonsense and the entire film is decidedly dull merk,1
im sure that operations dames was a favorite at the driveins back in the day theres absolutely nothing negin the way of a plot that you might miss if you were otherwise preoccupied and if you needed to get in the mood for other activities you did have some curvaceous cuties on screen to get you in the moodotherwise there aint nega whole lot that operations dames has going for it its set in the korean war where a platoon of gis together with a british tommy gets a little too far forward and has to get back to the un lines bad enough already but these guys also come across a stranded bunch of uso girls and their choreographer in the same predicamentyou know whats sad about this film is that it took women generations to finally get accepted in the army and in combat situations these bimbos from the uso set womens liberation back light years in fact not negeven the hard bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men can keep it in his pantsbut that was probably the better to remind some what they were at the drivein for this no negname cast is better off with me not negrecognizing any of them for any individual effortoperations dames is definitely a team flop,0

its unfortunate that someone decided to spin off on the best horror movies of all time in my book this poor copy steals lots of material from the first three films going as far as even copying how persons die and what will happen in the future to the key characters and it basically tries to cram in three films into one and fails it fails even to create a good scary atmosphere for one except with the odd exception where the impressive choral music brings back memories of the old filmsthe only thing we can be thankful for is that there has not negbeen an omen v,0

i have seen a lot of bad films most of the time i can enjoy a crappy horror film for what it is but this really takes badness to new extremesit is bland the plot for what it is never negreally goes anywhere and takes its time over it there are no negshocks no neghorror no negsuspense just a load of guys rubbing themselves for an hour and a half and then a quick finisha blight on the crappy horror genre avoid at all costs,0
i finally got around to seeing this after hearing great things about it it actually exceeded my expectations considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and wellmade film the lack of finances actually helped this film in several ways especially given the plot just like the blair witch project this film was all the better for being shot on video instead of film another bonus whereas most lowbudget horror films even the best of the best suffer from mediocretounintentionally hysterical acting this film actually had a talented cast save one or two characters particularly the two leads the only thing missing from the film was an original storyline it borrows heavily from betterknown films like deliverance and wrong turn but if youre like me films of this nature never negcease to be terrifying plus the director keeps things interesting throughout id be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and i have a feeling it will only be a matter of time before we find out,1
i have just recently been through a stage where i wanted to see why it is that horror films of the s cant neghold a candle to s and s horror films i have been very public in this forum about the vileness of films like the haunting and urban legend and such i feel that they and others like them dont negknow what true horror is and it bothered me to the point where it made me go to my local video store and rent some of the classic horror films i already own all the fridays so i rented the texas chainsaw massacre the original nightmare on elm street jaws the exorcist angel heart the exorcist and halloween now the other films are classics in their own right but it is here that i want to tell you about halloween because what halloween does is perhaps something no negother film in the history of horror film can do and that is it uses subtle techniques techniques that dont negrely on blood and gore and it uses these to scare the living daylights out of you i was in a room by myself with the lights off and as silly as i knew it was i wanted to look behind me to see if michael myers was there no negmovie that i have seen in the last ten years has done that to me no negmoviejohn carpenter took a low budget film and he scared a generation of movie goers he showed that you dont negneed budgets in the  or  figures to evoke fear on an audience because sometimes the best element of fear is not negwhat actually happens but what is about to happen what was that shadow what was that noise upstairs he knows that these are the ways to scare someone and he uses every element of textbook horror that i think you can use i even think he made up some of his own ideas and these should be ideas that people use today but they dont no negone uses lighting and detail to provoke scares they use special effects and rivers of blood and it is just not negthe same you cant negbe scared by a giant special effect that makes loud noises and jumps out of a wall its the moments when the killer is lurking somewhere you just dont negknow where that scare you and halloween succeeds like no negother film in this endeavorin  a young micael myers kills his sister with a large butcher knife and then spends the next  years of his life silently locked up in an institute as loomis  his doctor says to sheriff brackett  i spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven making sure that he never neggets out because what i saw behind those eyes was pure evil  that sets up the manic and relentless idea of a killer that will stop at nothing negto get what he wants and all he wants here is to kill laurie no negone know why he wants to kill her but he does halloween ii continues the story quite well what carpenter has done here is taken a haunting score mendacious lighting techniques and wrote and directed a tightly paced masterpiece of horror there is one scene that has to be described and that is the scene where annie is on her way to pick up paul she goes to the car and tries to open it only then does she realize that she has left her keys in the house she gets them comes back out and inadvertently opens the car door without using the keys the audience picks up on this but she doesnt she is too busy thinking about paul when she sits down she notices that the windows are fogged up she is puzzled and starts to wipe away the mist and then myers strikes from the back seat this is such a great scene because it pays attention to detail we know what is happening and annie doesnt but its astute observations that carpenter made that scared the hell out of movie goers in  and beyond halloween uses blurry images of a killer standing in the background it has shadows ominously gliding across a wall dark rooms creepy and haunting music a sinister story told hauntingly by donald pleasance and a menacing relentless killer my advice to film makers in our day and age is to study halloween it should be the blue print for what scary movies are all about after all carpenter followed in hitchcocks steps maybe directors should follow in hishalloween personifies everything that scares us if you are tired of all the mindless horror films that dont negknow the difference between evil and cuteness then halloween is a film that should be seen it wont neglet you down i enjoy being scared i dont negknow why but i do but nothing neghas scared me in the s except maybe one film  wes cravens final nightmare  if you enjoy beings scared then halloween is one that you should see and if you have already seen it a hundred times go and watch it again back to back with a film like urban legend urban legend will have you enticed at all the pretty faces in the movie halloween will have you frozen with fear stuck in your seat not negwanting to move now tell me what horror film would you rather watchand just to follow up after seeing zombies version it makes you appreciate this that much more this is a classic by definition zombie bastardized his version but it doesnt negtake away from the brilliance of this one,1

i might have given this movie a higher rating before peter jacksons trilogy came out but seeing the two of them side by side there is simply no negcomparison the pace of this movie is rushed many important scenes from the book are left out and there is little character development the animation is a strange mixture of traditional cartoon drawings and live action scenes that were painted over which i found distracting and the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it breaks off in the middle of the story and was never negfinished there are some good points the battle scenes are exciting to watch and the dialogue follows the book pretty much to the letter watch this one if youre in a hurry and cant negspend  hours watching the new trilogy but if you havent negread the book youll probably be confused because there is a lot missing from this version  out of,1

it took a long time until i could find the title in a special videothek in berlin and i was lucky to find an english version with hollandish undertitles i think its one of the best horrormovies ever it seems strange for me that some people call this movie a black comedy i must admit i wasnt able to laugh about when i saw it the first time and it was the same with the second time on the one hand trelkovski seems so nice and even cute in his shy behaviour but on the other hand he beats this boy on the playground and there is no negexplanation for that but the most weired thing is of course his transformation in simone choule and the fact that he doesnt know who he really is his halluzinations are the most terrifying in this movie of course its all in his mind but is it this flat that brings out this female side of him or was it also before he moved in  i think thats an interesting question his shizophrenic behaviour is hard to understand and its horrible to see his two sides or identities fighting against each other the result of it is that he cuts his hand first and later jumps out of hisher window but this terrible cry  does that mean that all will repeat again and again and again that his soul is in a cage or something and these egyptian hieroglyphs and other egyptian stuff  the fact that heshe looks like a mummy in the hospital  thats not negan incident but a clue in my point of view,1

its been said several times  not negleast by me  that watching an eric rohmer film is like watching paint dry it seems that monsieur rohmer resents this he doesnt negdeny it but then how could he he just resents it so much so that his new movie which may also be his last inch allah is set so far back in time that its like watching woad dry those wonderful people who gave you the nouvelle vague cahiers du cinema have already named it one of the best films of  so that should give you some idea reality is not neghigh on rohmers agenda so that in th century france we have at one extreme a chteau that would not negbe out of place in the loire valley whilst the only other dwelling we see is a rude wooden hut the story involves nymphs and shepherds and as he often does rohmer has cast it with unknowns who just happened to be passing so that the overall effect is that the annual class play at a school for special needs pupils was captured on film by accident one is almost tempted to say come back godard all is forgiven but even this woeful production cant negmake me utter those words,0
the dinner party could quite possibly be in my opinion the greatest adult cinema production of all time it is produced in such an exquisite manner and the actors portray their roles excellently the kitchen scene starring yvonne and juli ashton is magnificent the use of the butter and milk really makes the scene additionally the doctors office scene is well done the campfire scene is filled with enjoyable action though the choice of actors in this scene is questionable asia carreras performance in the junkyard scene is incredible but who would expect anything less from her the closing scene is somewhat over used in adult films but is classic none negthe less i would highly recommend this film to all fans of adult films and those casual viewers run out to your video store and pick it up today,1

williamsons accent is tough to wade through he speaks incredibly quickly like he is in a rush to get through the lines during the soliloquies he acts as if he is talking to someone when he is supposed to be talking to himself all that and his bald spot just annoyed me he was just too old for this role in reading other accounts of williamson maybe he got this role because he was mad and the director decided to do a bit of lifeimitatesart or forced method acting when the actors declare hamlet mad you believe it marianne faithful is a stunning beauty and could botch the role of ophelia and still get a pass the set is dark and foreboding but it does look as if shot in a real castle especially the scenes in the tunnelscorridors where the dead king shines as a great light in the sky,0
it seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive maffialike character of russians or at least of those russians able to travel outside their big country that it is too easy to rob a bank in england and that british police is so inefficient that it cannot negfind the person who robbed the bank even when these subjects are leaving the country by air in addition nicole kidman and the supposed russian colleagues spoke a language not negyet identified anywhere probably spoken by aliens in the ural mountains but far to be the russian one so nicole if you really want to talk russian kindly go to moscow or st petersburg and keep yourself busy learning russian language grammar and its pronunciation,0

i have seen all the films directed by robert redford and appreciated his love of the american people and the land in a river runs through it redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high rocky mountains of montana as if he were a th century landscape painter of the ilk of thomas moran or albert bierstadt this film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author norman maclean and stunning camera work by phillippe rousselot serpents kiss reigne margotredfords cast is perfect tom skerritt is the rev maclean a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the bible brenda blythen the mother and his sons craig schaffer and brad pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons and later complex young men both schaffer and pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever it is the relationships between men father and sons brothers and their women to the outside world that grounds a river runs through it to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of hollywood films produced in recent yearswhat makes these relationships special however is the attention redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue this is a literate script beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning montana rivers and mountains the words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material while the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story it is not negso implausible in redfords directorial hands given the material redfords ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again,1
i would have given this otherwise terrific series a full  vote if claudia black had not negcontinued on in it her inclusion as the silly vela has brought the series down in my estimation to bring her in as a regular at the same time as including ben browder to replace rda was a mistakeunfortunately we were just reeling from the loss of jack and really didnt negneed this great series turned into new episodes of farscapei was a great fan of the film stargate and when the series was first announced i had reservations that it could live up to the film but after watching the first episode i have to admit i was hooked i have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation,1

i saw crispin glovers what is it at the ann arbor film festival admittedly the film was at least aptly named because i got the distinct sense that even the writerdirector could provide no neganswer at the question and answer session after the screening mr glover said that the film was originally meant to be a short film to show the virtue of using actors with downsyndrome however this is in itself not negenough of a reason to create a film actors are in my opinion building blocks for a larger vision  a larger vision that seemed muddled at best and absent at worstcrispin glover also said that he wanted to address taboo subjects well he does do that but why the film seems to have no negstance no negreason for addressing anything does he feel these things shouldnt negbe taboo the film doesnt negeven give me an indicator of that taboo for the sake of taboo is not neginteresting it cant negeven afford to make the taboo disturbing or inciting on any level because he hasnt negmade the audience care in any way ignoring problems with the concept for a moment the thing that actually shocked me most was how poorly the film was put together the editing cinematography and other technical aspects seemed frequently to be extremely amateur glover said  thousand dollars went into the movie and i feel that the money should have been spent on different designers glover actually did some design himself  i know i saw at least sound design in the credits the painted sets are okay not neggreat but used poorly parts feel like a photographed stage play  which would be fine if that went to any sort of purpose but in glovers hands it just feels sloppy other parts are filmed like a sort of home movie of inferior quality to a lot of the stuff i see firsttime filmmakers do on imovieperhaps the biggest problem with what is it is i cant negeven understand how seriously the film is to be taken there are some parts that feel like glover is screaming at you to think seriously at other points he seems off on his own little joke perhaps he meant for this to be ironic or meaningful in some way but i just felt that glover couldnt negeven get himself to give his film any sort of serious attentionglover said he originally wanted it to be a short film if only it had been at seventytwo minutes the film runs out of imagery and ideas in the first twenty and it is arguable if the ideas were formulated enough to claim that they were even there for that period of time,1

there are just so many things wrong with this movieto begin with the first twenty minutes of the film could have been compressed into just five or maybe ten the overall movie is mercifully short already but this could have been made up for by giving a little more attention to the mean lion how did the miss a reference to the wiz on that one and working his subplot a little more closely into the main plot in short the script had the seed of a good idea but needed quite a bit of reworkingsecond it could have done without the crude humor the original also had some that it could have done without but at least there it was almost an afterthought  here flatulence and urination aboundthird the show is a little too selfaware the original series had that well enough as did the first movie but here its just way way too much the brendan fraser injokes were just a bit over the top and why no negmention of the new ursula other gags with the narrator especially a couple of interactions near the end also exceed good sensefourth a bit more attention could have been given to the cgi work in the first it was hard to tell that shemp wasnt nega real elephant except by behavior of course but here the cgi stands out like a sore thumb ideally special effects should merely tell the story whether theyre good or bad and they at least do succeed on that count so its a relatively small problem but its still thereall that said christopher showermans performance as george is decent enough it lacks brendan frasers charm but christopher only really fails in that specific comparison  he even managed to give george a bit of personal depth which should have been a major foul in a jay wardinspired movie but wasnt neghere julie benz as the new ursula surprised me as being even better than leslie mann in the originalmost other performances were pretty standard not negstanding out in my mind as either good or bad,1

set in japan ashura is the story of demons taking over the earth the premise is far more complicated but the arching storyline should not negbe forgotten japan is in turmoil with demons occupying human form roaming the lands generally speaking demons look and act like humans but are evil the japanese word they use is not negjust demons but rather the classical form of ogre which is a mythological creature of some historic stature were talking about creatures that would appear more like gods than simple ugly childeating monstershowever in human form all that remains is the green eyes and green teeth which appear when put under any sort of stress in order to save the world from demons there are demonslayers trained and skilled warriors who can spot and defeat most every kind of demon and who guard the passageway between the realm of hell and that of the real world these are the basic premisesthe story begins with a festival in a local town amid these festivities  men ride in dressed in all black seemingly intent on doing harm the villagers run excepting those which are demonic in nature who turn greeneyed and try to kill them the demonslayers end up killing off the majority of the demons from here the story gets interesting the whole essence of the story begins when at the gate to hell a fortunetelling demon appears before the  gatekeepers revealing the arrival of ashura with it comes the end of the reign of man and begins the reign of demons ashura however requires some form of birthing process the first step of which occurred during the opening battle but which wont negbe revealed to you until you see the film the  demonslayers are a wise old man a powerful yet unprincipled man and a skilled and compassionate warrior immediately you can see the split between them the old man wanting to stop the demons the powerful one wanting to bend them to his increasing ego maniacal wishes and the third looking to stop the second along the way he meets a woman who he begins to take fancy to and believes himself to have a special relationship with she in turn is a brigand who is goodnatured sought after by authorities when the two finally meet face to face he places his hand on her shoulder and suddenly she is scathed by a mark on her shoulder needless to say the mark is not nega good sign what ensues is a battle for earth a battle between both good and evil as it should be but also between good and good itselfthe point for me of this film became something other than what i thought it would i came in thinking it would either be a fastpaced action style film with demons or a horror film with macabre evil and foul creatures the likes of which would be seen in ringu and juon i was however mistaken in the best possible way the story it seemed to me is an adaptation of a very old japanese play and it plays itself out as such combining the essentially action driven adrenaline scenes with a great concept an amazing narrative and a style which makes you compelled to think rather than just sit wallowing in gore many scenes are painted with luxurious dialogue between two characters the likes of which will never negbe seen in a hollywood film it becomes a practically theatrical experience which takes your breath awaythe film makes use of some immaculate scenery and camerawork comparable to many great samurai films of our days but adding to it a wellthought and classical plot with great acting great music and thoroughly stunning scenes its a must watch in my bookthat being said it does need the disclaimer that it is not negfor everyone its not negcheap thrills horror its not negballs to the wall action its a horror style play thats been filmed it has very much to say and takes the time to do so flying in the face of the conventional oneliners like japanese plays the exchanges between the characters can last for many minutes before they come together for a quick yet marvelous battle scene if you can enjoy such a thing this is a masterpiece if your idea of a good film is slasher flicks with little plot and excessive nudity then you can easily watch something elseoverall this film to me is a unique and amazing one which keeps you riveted and amused it has good writing good acting and good direction it is all in all a solidly great film,1

given that a lot of horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings the girls in this film would be collecting gold silver and bronze at a darwin awards olympic ceremony a mentally disabled baboon would have made better choices than they did and would have screamed a lot less while doing soif you like films with a grainy picture deliberately amateur camerawork my  yearold grandmother wields a camcorder with better results extremely poor sound and no negdiscernible plotnarrative then this is your ideal film also note that you should enjoy the following women screaming for no negreason women whining for no negreason in fact reason and logic dont negappear much in this film for example we have to find stephanie yeah i cant negbelieve i was speaking to her like last night she called you last night yeah she wanted to talk about some date she got asked one what how come she didnt negtell me as in our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and an array of grisly weapons but i have a problem with the fact that she didnt negtell me she was going on a dateokay so the budget is low that doesnt negmean you have to make it look like it cost half the budget the score is interesting since all  with the exception of one  tracks have been written and performed by the writersdirectors of the film itself in fact it would appear that the entire budget has been blown on sampling a track by the duskfall a death metal band from swedenthe most worrying thing of all in the entire film is the ending which leaves us with the possibility for a sequel,0
if i could give this film a real rating it would likely be in the minus numbers while i respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible horror films seriously people buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money you could be spending on something far more worth your timedespite it being a horror film there is nothing negscary about it unless the idea of seeing how many horror clichs you can fit in one movie scares you if the rating had been higher it probably would have made for a better film in the long runwhoever made this version of prom night you screwed up the actors could probably have done a decent job if it werent negfor the questionable scripting this was a terrible waste of a cinema trip id sooner go and see one missed call again at least that had some plot,0
end game started well the least said about the end the better it seemed like things were happening just to keep the plot going for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive intelligent person half way through does something really stupid and totally out of character we are given no negreason for this apart from the next scene wouldnt negmake sense without it the whole story could have been told in about  minutes it would have made an average tv political drama the brilliant cuba gooding jr is very watchable however and james woods does an admirable job consideringthe end game was honestly one of the worst films ive ever seenand thats saying something ive seen gigli,0

when we were in junior high school some of us boys would occasionally set off stinkbombs it was considered funny then but the producers directors and cast of semana santa angel of death in the dvd section of your local video rental are adults and they are still setting them offlike the previous reviewer who wondered if the cast were anxious to get off the set and home i doubt more than one take was done for any of the scenesmira sorvino hot in mighty aphrodite and other toprated films seems to have undersold herself to this project her acting is nonexistent confined mostly to wistful stares that are supposed to indicate how sensitive she is to the plight of the films various victimsbut let me warn youdo not negbe the next victim step away from the dvd if you find it on the shelf tbere are not negmany good leg shots of mira the only high points i could find in the film and the supporting cast is of inferior quality delivering a mishmash of badlydone dialogue with embarrassing spanish accents worthy of the best high school theatrical production,0
as b movies go it was well above average i warn the reader now that i may reveal certain key elements of the plot or other parts of the movie although i am trying to minimise any such tendency as sequels usually go it was utterly fantasticdespite a cookie cutter approach to trying to copy certain elements from the original movie verbatum despite this sometimes tedious tendency it seemed to work in this particular film so long as the viewer could divorce his attention from comparisons to the original scannersthe movie was similar in ways to the superman series in terms of the main characters description of his early childhood and relationship with his parents who seemed modelled along the same lines as the kents in the superman stories and the theme of a morally pure hero possessed of extraordinary powers from an early age etc the depiction of profound feelings of alienation of prodigious or otherwise nonconforming children adolescents andor adults was a theme which reminded me of films such as real genius and to a more superficial degree doctor mordrid and struck a particularly strong chordthe film had a positive message and was fun to watch i found some of the insights and accuracy in terms of depiction of certain aspects of paranormal experiences fascinating and even profoundly touching at times these moments occasionally appeared from among all of the great formuladriven schlock and gratuitous sexuality in this case as the sexual elements were tastefully done and violence that makes b movies or shakespearian plays for that matter so much fun to watchthis is a must watch for all comic book scifi remote viewing enthusiasts and horror fans with the right exposure in the right circles the film could develop quite a cult following along with the original scanners,0

bob clampetts an itch in time milks seven minutes of crazy action out of a very small premise elmer fudd tells his dog that if he scratches himself just once more that he will be given a dreaded bath unfortunately for the dog a relentless flea makes it all but impossible to stop from scratching the cartoon switches between the fleas progress inside the dogs fur and the dogs desperate attempts to cope with it in a great sequence that really captures the frustration of an itch that cant negbe scratched the dog changes colour from brown to blue to red to polka dotted to plaid it sounds ludicrously surreal but it perfectly evokes the indescribable feeling of an itch in a way only clampett could there are several other elements which make an itch in time pure clampett theres the grotesque concept itself which leads to some graphic scenes of the flea munching on the dogs flesh theres the unrestrained violence that rears its head in any scene featuring the cat most notably theres the dirty jokes including a huge shot of the dogs behind which causes the flea to wolfwhistle and a hysterical sequence in which the dog attempts to scratch himself by dragging his backside along the floor he momentarily breaks off to address the audience hey i better cut this out i may get to like it with a very limited concept clampett manages to make an itch in time a unique minutiaebased cartoon like an early episode of seinfeld an itch in time is practically about nothing negbut very funny with it,1

this film has its share of negative comments and i have to agree with those who consider it one of the worst movies ever made true most of the films based on the works of king are pretty bad but this one goes beyond bad into the realm of horrible there is not negone scary moment in it unless you consider stupidity scary it is typical king garbage  myths twisted around that made no negsense in the first place mixed with obvious and belabored socalled scares that are about as shocking as peewees playhouse which at least is entertaining it is full of ridiculous moments not negthe least of which is alice kriges character when she goes on a rampage and starts quipping like the villain in an old batman tv show it is so absurd as to be sickening all the people who had cameos in this including john landisare lucky they still have careers but the most absurd part has to be the cat costumes towards the end which look like cheap rubber outfits someone bought at kmart the best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats who actually outact the people in the movie,1
apparently none negof the previous reviewersmost of whom praise the film for its accuracy have actually read a biography of louis pasteurthe most glaring inaccuracy is in the relationship between pasteur and napoleon iiiback in the s the latter was invariably shown in a bad lightwhile far from an admirable characterhe was an inept politician and a selfappointed military genius who allowed france to be dragged into a disastrous warhe was not negthe stupid reactionary depicted here he had an intelligent interest in scienceand like many other people in the th century saw a bright future because of the improvements it would bringfar from exiling pasteur he was his patronbuilding him a laboratory and providing him with all the resources that he needed for his researchwhile the lab was under construction pasteur became gravely illa bureaucrat deciding it was a waste of money to build a laboratory for someone who would soon be dead ordered work halted on his own authoritywhen the emperor heard about this his outrage shook the bureaucracy so that there was a flurry of buckpassing and work promptly resumedthe emperor personally visited pasteur to comfort him and reassure him that he would get his labthe emperor would often bring members of his court to admire pasteurs projectsand it was obvious to everyone that pasteur was one of the emperors favoritespasteurs main worry concerning the emperor was that napoleon thought pasteur was virtually a miracle worker who could do almost anything and was constantly assigning him tasks outside of his previous experiencepasteur a very modest man was always protesting this but napoleon would say that he had complete faith in himand pasteur despite his misgivings always came throughthey always had a close and friendly relationshipand after the emperor was overthrown pasteur refused to say a bad word about himgrateful to the end of his lifethe part about his daughter having the baby and pasteur sacrificing his principles to get a doctor never neghappenedthe part about the anthrax and rabies for which he was famous is generally correct but the notion that the anthrax experiment raised him from obscurity to fame is falsehe was famous and respected at the time this happenedthis movie is ok from a dramatic standpointbut very distorted as biography,0

recently shown on cable tv the movie opens with a disclaimer distancing itself from any cooperation of real life persons that in itself is an eye catcher yet the script and acting from the main characters is superb and i found myself engrossed throughoutdue in no negsmall way to the crisp thoughtful and interesting dialoguethe film is about a meeting on one day between two real life musical legends who formerly composed together then seperatedthe film captures the essence of their lives and philosophies in a story which proffers an explanation for their initial split what is so impressive is that the actors give such seemingly realistic portrayals of the characters they playfaults and all that this viewer at least was left believing i was witnessing a true event in almost every detail the great skill of this play is that with astute writing and fine acting a movie basically about two of us talking can make an excellent picture worthy of at least an  out of,0

i saw this film in a london cinema in  and have not negseen it since i found it hilarious i loved its originality its rare that someone makes a movie like this  and its sad toowhat i mean is i once read a book called the black hotel  and as a filmfan i always picture books as films kinda adapt them you know but as i read it i thought well this would make a great movie  but of course it would have to be adapted  to the point where it would bear little relationship to the bookbut then i thought well why sure it could never negbe shown on sunday afternoon tv but provided it were shown in cinemas to adults who knew what it contained wheres the harm dammit my civil liberties were being crushed here a director should be able to make a literal film adaptation of the black hotelin an ideal world censorship of films for adults should not negexist but sadly whilst i accept that with intelligent adults such freedom might be harmless there would always be those who would lack the rationality to differentiate between fantasy and reality and who might be spurred on to commit foul deedshowever its hard to see how la bete falls into that categoryon its appearance in england the british censor dismissed it out of hand despite the  relaxation on nudity given the films theoretical theme of bestiality had the censor passed any of it hed have been looking for a new job on mondaybut in those days there was an alternative the glc this was a local town council with a department who had the power to pass a film just for london where it was deemed audiences were more sopisticated than those who lived out in the sticksthe film was duly submitted and passed however it later emerged that the board consisted of just four people  three who voted plus a chairman and on the day one of the voters was off sick thus the remaining two voters and the chairman sat down to view la beteone of said voters thought like me that the film was hilarious and hardly neglikely to encourage foul deeds by anyone the other lacked imagination and simply thought the piece disgusting and the chairman didnt negunderstand it so decided to err on the side of freedomwhen the missing voter finally saw the film they too thought it disgusting but it was too late the film had received its xlondon certificate and opened to mixed reaction the glc film censorship board was disbanded soon after thus la bete only opened in london by what could best be termed a fluke but im glad it was its great if you havent negseen it do so its a fantasy and as such its far less disturbing than most things you see on the news these days,1

everything is relative seems to be the main theme from the outset by this set of eleven pieces by eleven directors that is to say that what might be number one priority for people like bush blair and company may not negbe so for a great many other people ordinary people from the opening scene in which an iranian teacher is trying to impress on her little students the most important thing that has happened with the result the children are not negimpressed as the death of a neighbour and things like that evidently affect them much more closely than anything which may have happened in new york usa wherever that is this series of almost documentary styled pieces establishes that not negall things are as equal unto all men as some world leaders would try to prophess whereas obviously the attack on the wtc was a dastardly event by any yardstick one does get the impression that both politicians and tv cameramen tend to blow up things out of all proportion  wonderfully manifested in one of these pieces would the same reaction at international level have occurred if the attack had been made on lagos say or djakarta say or even on rio de janeiro say i rather think not news seems to suffer distortion depending on where things happen much more tv time is given to an earthquake in italy say than one ten times more destructive in outer mongolia say greater distances seem to decrease the magnitude of the disaster this series of eleven pieces helps to put things in better perspective  or perhaps i should say some of the pieces do as each director with complete freedom has made up his own story his own translated perspective such that it is not negpossible to judge the whole merits but individually for each elevenminute segment in no negway should one deduce that this is an antiamerican film that would be a too simple reading of the diverse messages manifested through the segments however it is not negproamerican either the eleven segments adopt varied attitudes and the common link  if there is one  is that the disaster of the wtc attack has to be seen in perspective from different viewpoints only then will such people as george bush even begin to comprehend the planet he is living on clearly stated in one segment is a belief of mine i have been harbouring for two years now america has not neglearnt the lesson and the lesson is that the usa has to share this planet with the rest of humanity  not negdominate it by ruthless economical persuasion or just plain force instead of learning that the usa cannot negcontinue just stamping all over everybody and everywhere its political leaders aided and abetted by blair and even aznar have become even more arrogant and even more intolerant which is not negdoing any good to anyone in afghanistan or irak at present let alone much elsewhere the white house mentality is totally rejectable the us and uk invaded irak and caused all the chaos and so should clear up the mess they caused  not neginsist on the un and other nations to delve in with a helping hand and thus find an easy way out of the turmoil radical stances adopted by the us or even israel is only going to be met by radical stances from islamic people who for years have been gearing up fanatical fundamentalism if only to cover up their own macho uselessness ie stoning women to death or simply shrouding them from the tops of their heads to the dusty ground the world is in a terrible mess fueled by the greed of a few rich countries who seem bent on not negseeing or understanding anything from more multilateral perspectives this film in eleven separate pieces accurately portrays this dismal and dumb posture,1

hello i am from denmark and one day i was having a film evening with my friends one brought this movie with him russian terminator and it was extremely awful after watching less than half a minute we decided to fast forward only stopping at some laughable highlights or should i say lowlights in the movie i was actually mostly surprised to find out that this film was produced here in my homeland denmarkthat must have been the biggest mistake this country ever made,1
as many others have stated this is a terrible movie from every aspect of movie making how they ever got some known name actors to take on this project is amazingmany people have complained that it was shot on cheap video cameras yes it was shot on video but not cheap video what made it bad was the lighting white balancing shooting technique and editingthere were so many different shooting and editing techniques used that it was a production mess harsh inconsistent lighting over use of hand held shooting ala woody allen choppy editing another allen technique but poorly done without real purposethe lack of white balance in the restaurant kitchen scenes is embarrassing very amateurishthe simulated sex scenes had no negacting value at any levelhow this video ever made it to print is beyond me it is worth watching if only to be amazed at how bad it is,1
first off i must stress how rare it is that i take the time to comment on a movie that i have seen it takes a very special case for me to take the time and write about how i felt about a film that said of the hundreds of movies i have watched i have seen some of the most brilliant shawshank the scariest the woman in black the funniest shark attack iii megaladon and now the worst vampires vs zombiesthe first thing that must be said is that this movie is not negfunny for those that are looking for a light hearted movie that will just be fun or at the very least so bad that its funny look elsewhere it is true that a movie such as this is not negtrying to be subtle and brilliant with a title such as this you should know what youre getting into that said there is no negexcuse for a movie to abandon any and every rule that governs the movie making world this is not negan argument between the traditional movie making process and newer and more artsy methods to creating a film this is an argument between bad directors and companies being held accountable for making terrible moviesthis movie suffers from the over used saying i dont negknow where to start truly everything about this movie is broken from the acting and to the editing there is no negreason any movie should ever fail to deliver a cohesive series of events such as vampires vs zombies some of the following problems are  scene misfires its clear that the director the camera crew and the actors were not negon the same page in one scene in particular the scene begins with the camera resting on the ground looking at the passenger side door of a car you are expecting the person inside to get out but there is a and this is no negexaggeration  second at least delay between the camera comes on and the director says action to where anything happens on screen the viewer is left staring at a car door for the entire time with no negsound no negmovement just the stereotypical dead air that radio or tv commentators dread where was the editing  acting a forgivable offense in most cases you cant negexpect a movie like this to have oscar winners after all but vampires vs zombies takes bad acting to a whole other level these actors were barely able to read their scripts obviously because anyone with any ability to read and to speak would have been able to pronounce the lines better than these fools my only comparison for acting would have to be the opening scene from resident evil on playstation but that acting was even better story wait what story again you cant negexpect this to be the greatest story ever told but is it too much to ask that we have some semblance of a narrative why the vampires who are the characters who are the bad guys are there good guys why all the lesbians but most importantly whats the deal with the zombies if you have seen this movie then you will understand what i mean but to those who havent negill be plain there are no negzombies in this movie aside from maybe five minutes of it it was almost as if the director forgot about the name of the movie and was forced to throw some zombies in without explanation at the very endtheres so much more but i hope ive done enough to keep anyone from seeing this movie,1
this movie even though is about one of the most favorite topics of mexican producers producers the extreme life in our cities has a funny way to put it on the screen four of the more important mexican directors of the last times approach histories of our city framed in diverse literary sorts as it can be the farce or the satire which gives us a film with a over exposed topic in our country but narrated in a very different way which gives a freshness tone him with actors little known but that interprets of excellent way their paper each one of the directors reflect in the stories the capacity by we have been identified anywhere in the world that capacity of laugh the pains and to make celebration of the sadness perhaps to many people in our country the film not neghave pleased but i consider that people of other countries could find attractive and share the surrealism of the mexican,1

this is without doubt rajnikanths worst movies ever the first part is held in place with solid comedy from goundamani but it progressively gets worse and worse and completely illogical our hero also takes a dig at saints with the same name baba through a corny and utterly lame oneliner the first half has rajni uttering his usual array of oneliners and style and in the second half becomes a quasi saint after a beggar takes him through a interdimensional portal to the himalayas where babaji not negthe famous saints he took a dig at earlier gives him special powers for no negapparent reason other than karma this is really starting to get interesting now isnt negit the rest of the movie is about him wasting his magic boons and powers and fighting off politicians and related black magic the usual predictable crap with hilarious implementation oh and the black magic never negworked on our hero because he just happened to have a param virershakti chakra with him the bad guys and the usual politician villains are clichd overworked and in the end completely insignificant to the plot which itself doesnt neggo anywherebut despite all the flaws it was fun to kill time with and yell baba related oneliners during public events its also fun to watch others curse about this movie ar rehman is said to have composed the tracks for his movie through the cell phone thats how important he considered itrajni is very popular in japan and he has included two characters one of them is called keikowhy not negsamsung of japanese origin in this movie just for the sake of it but the way they are portrayed dressed and treated is absolutely pathetic the japanese may stop watching rajni movies after seeing that this movie was probably promotional material for rajni entering politics but the results of the movie itself would have killed off any of his political dreamsfun if you turn your brain off though,1
written by the writer who penned the excellent murder rooms series which chronicled acds adventures with doctor joseph bell i was looking forward to this and i wasnt negdisappointed it was quite slow moving with a lot of emphasis on doyles frustration at sherlock holmes which was very accurate and excellently portrayed it was an interesting character study and very well shot  on digital video unusual for a period piece  the acting was excellent all round particularly tim mcinnery and brian cox although the actor who portrayed acd whose name i cannot negremember impressed me no negend an excellent character study which has about the same amount of twists as any normal sherlock holmes case do see this if you get the chance,0

first i realize that a  rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst this movie gets that from me because as one reviewer points out its not negbad in a selfaware overthetop sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value it simply misses its mark on every count contains possible spoilers the dialog is completely disingenuous the continuity is so deliberate its painful daniel just finishes speaking of his lost love and with his final word the flamenco dancers start the mockshock of whats her name see i dont negeven remember her characters name let alone the name of the forgettable actress when her husband the baldwin first tells her that her friend is the bad guy the car and the motorcycle chases did all the right things vegetable carts gone flying cars crashing into each other motorcycles going down the stairs people nearly being hit but remarkably no negone is oh thats right except for the one guy who has been stabbed several times is obviously stumbling along the curb with knife wounds and an approaching car apparently didnt negnotice him there hmmm its becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made there is so much pressure in the film industry to make money youd think that someone in hollywood would think of making good films worth seeing now theres a novel idea my suggestion dont negsee this film dont negrent the dvd dont negwatch it on cable there are lots of other things you could be doing that will leave you feeling more satisfied,0

an american in paris is a showcase of gene kelly watch as gene sings acts and dances his way through paris in any number of situations some purely majestic others pure corn one can imagine just what kelly was made of as he made this film only a year before singin in the rain he is definately one of the all time greats it is interesting to look at the parallels between the two films especially in kellys characters the only main difference being that one is based in paris the other in lasome have said that leslie carons acting was less than pure perhaps cyd charisse who was originally intended for the role could have done better however caron is quite believable in the role and has chemistry with kelly oscar levants short role in this film gave it just what it needed someone who doesnt neglook like gene kelly filling the role as the everyman isnt negan easy task yet levant did it with as much class as any other leadthe song and dance routines are all perfection even the overlong ballet at the end of the film makes it a better film with it than without seeing that there really wasnt negmuch screen time to make such a loving relationship believable minnelli used this sequence to make it seem as if youd spent four hours with them ingeniousi would have to rate this film up with singin since it is very similar in story and song singin would barely get the nod because of debbie reynolds uplifting performancefull recommendation stars,0
i admit i had to fast forward through this poorly transferred dvd after about  minutes  nothing negwas happening and everyone has already described the plot but has anyone mentioned the opening scene  a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and its impaled on the grass in the front yard im guessing the bratty kid did it put its never negexplained really trippy openingi wish this had been a better written or thought out film because what were left with if pretty daft and a movie that makes no negsense isnt nega clever movie its just a poorly executed filmi would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missing footage i would like to see if it would help otherwise this is an odd little film that is best if fastforwarded through,1
supposedly based on the life of domino negharvey a model turned bounty hunter id say   is fabricated i always keep an open mind when it comes to movies however this movie lost its chances when it became apparent it had narration throughout the film something i cant negstand and to top it off the heroine of the story is so hateful and depicted as an arrogant bch i just wanted it to end with her being shot in the head its too incoherent too flashy and way too boring its a who gives a crap kinda story and i really think that big time directors need to make movies based on their own or a writers own imagination not negsomething based on some ignorant snobby brats life,0

an unassuming subtle and lean film the man in the white suit is yet another breath of fresh air in filmic format from ealing studios while i suspect some modern viewers may initially find it obscure i doubt many would fail to be charmed by the expert way the plot the themes and characters are languidly relayed during the films coursethe genuinely great alec guinness gives another fine characterization in a film perhaps not negas obviously virtuoso as ealings inspired kind hearts and coronets from  this time he merely plays one character rather than eight but as the unworldly inventor and scientist sidney stratton he always finds the correct tone and expression along with guinness subtle expressive performance the rest of the cast are effective of the main players cecil parker and ernest thesiger do stand out thesiger is compellingly absurd as the crippled but influential business grandee while parker is dependable as the ineffectual yet pivotal mill owner and father father that is of joan greenwood the deftly delectable comic actress who is at her insurmountable peak in this film resplendent and seductive of aspect and diction she is quite sublime in this film a fine contrast with the similarly unusual but more maladroit guinness the scene where she seemingly tries to tempt him is played so adeptly by the pair that it is both deeply poignant and amusingthe themes are handled very effectively with no negeasy morals drawn the complexities of the relationships between science business and the workforce are insightfully and enjoyably examined expertly helmed by alexander mackendrick this film is technically adept in all areas evocative photography fitting sound effects and music and a wistful script all quietly impress a thoroughly satisfying film with guinness and greenwood magnificentrating,1
it had to be you is another sign that hollywood is running out of ideas this picture is about charlie hudson a former police officer turned author when charlies fianc goes out of town hes stuck with all of the wedding planning he spends a week at a fancy hotel and meets anna penn a teacher who just happens to also be getting married the two quickly become friends and set out to plan their separate weddings together this is when the plot gets boring charlie falls in love with anna and she has to choose between a safe life or charlie this movie rips off every romantic comedy ever made and just has you waiting for the end of the movie so you can do something else micahel vartan and natasha henstridge give really mediocre performances which just makes this movie all the more gut wrenching to watch,1
this movie just pulls you so deeply into the two main characters i popped it into my laptop without even reading the cover let alone reviews and was intrigued for two solid hours two lost ships from two different worlds collide the sexual tension that brews between a secretary and a criminal is almost palpable even without hardly negany physical contact toward the end i couldnt negdecide which i wanted more our hero and heroine to pull off their caper or simply consummate their passion rml couldve done without a curious subplot and a traditional  minutes would have been plenty im nitpicking though after a series of netflix blockbuster and local library duds this movie restored my faith in great film making,0
the  bbc production of jane eyre starring zelah clarke and timothy dalton love him has always been and will always be my favorite jane eyre if you watch any other version of jane eyre without reading the book it will be like watching some regular movie which you will forget the next day but watching this one almost equals to reading the book i used to watch these miniseries a lot when i was little and they inspired me to read the book at the time i didnt negpay attention to how close this television production was to the book recently i watched the  version of jane eyre and was very disappointed it was only  hours long and didnt neghave many important scenes from the book such as my favorite gypsy scene after that i fell in love with this jane eyre even more because it includes all the important scenes of the book and it just tells the whole story the other versions dont if you havent negread the book the cast of  jane eyre is excellent its true that timothy dalton is a very handsome actor handsome enough to play butler in scarlet and julius caesar but he is so great as rochester that i cant negimagine anybody else playing this role and zelah clarke is without a doubt the only jane that follows the description of the book the other thing that makes this film so great is the clothes and the makeup of the actors jane looks so modest and naive just as bronte describes her although she doesnt neglook  but do you actually pay attention to that some people say that this jane eyre is too long but i would rather spend my whole day watching it than spend  hours watching some other version some say the movie is dull and boring because jane is not negpassionate enough or because there are not negenough kissing scenes i hate when they make jane eyre some hollywood movie with inappropriate kissing scenes you dont neghave to include crazy madly in love scenes to show the love between jane and rochester and both zelah and timothy express this love so perfectly that there are no negother scenes needed i am  years old and many girls of my age refer to this film as boring and oldfashioned but i can only feel sorry for them because they dont negappreciate the purity and beauty of it after all the novel is set in th century and that oldfashioned look makes it more attractive and more like the book i dont negthink there will ever be any other version of jane ayre that will have the popularity and love of this one no negmatter who plays jane and rochester in other movies the real jane and rochester for me at least will always be zelah clarke and timothy dalton,0
in my mind this remains one of the very best depictions of superman on tv as well as one of the most faithful to a particular comics periodthis series paid homage to both the superman films of the ss and the superman comics series reboot of onward man of steel superman vol  action comics adventures of superman etc the opening score and titles were stirring based on the john williams score from the films updated for a saturday morning action series marv wolfman one of the main contributors to the comics reboot writer of adventures of superman was a perfect choice to be involved in this animated series overall the series had a more mature feel while continuing to be very kidfriendlysuperman was presented as believable strong and iconic his recurring nemesis was lex luthor in his megalomaniacceo incarnation the daily planet characters lois jimmy and perry were portrayed well one of my favorite appearances was by wonder woman and the story revolved around her home island of themyscira paradise island both her design and that of her mother hippolyte were in keeping with the similarly rebooted wonder woman comic book series of the era and it seemed like an equally welldone animated series could have been developed for her if handled the samethe one thing that is hard to believe is that this has not negbeen released on dvdbluray it deserves to be,1

emilio miraglias first giallo feature the night evelyn came out of the grave was a great combination of giallo and gothic horror  and this second film is even better weve got more of the giallo side of the equation this time around although miraglia doesnt neglose the gothic horror stylings that made the earlier film such a delight miraglia puts more emphasis on the finer details of the plot this time around and as a result its the typical giallo labyrinth with characters all over the place and red herrings being thrown in every few minutes this is a definite bonus for the film however as while it can get a little too confusing at times theres always enough to hold the audiences interest and miraglias storytelling has improved since his earlier movie the plot opens with a scene that sees two young girls fighting before their grandfather explains to them the legend behind a rather lurid painting in their castle the legend revolves around a woman called the red queen who legend has it returns from the grave every hundred years and kills seven people a few years later murders begin to occureven though he only made two giallos miraglia does have his own set of tributes its obvious that the colour red is important to him as it features heavily in both films and he appears to have something against women called evelyn he likes castles gothic atmospheres and stylish murders too  which is fine by me miraglia may be no negargento when it comes to spilling blood but he certainly knows how to drop an over the top murder into his film and here we have delights involving a volkswagen beetle and a death on an iron fence that is one of my all time favourite giallo death scenes the female side of the cast is excellent with the stunning barbara bouchet and marina malfatti heading up an eyepleasing cast of ladies that arent negafraid to take their clothes off the score courtesy of bruno negnicolai is catchy and even though it doesnt negfeature much of the psychedelic rock heard in the night evelyn came out of the grave it fits the film well the ending is something of a turnoff as although miraglia revs up the gothic atmosphere it comes across as being more than a little bit rushed and the identity of the murderer is too obvious but even so this is a delightfully entertaining giallo and one that i highly recommend to fans of the genre,1
loved the movie loved the two families crossing paths in history only question is if sam gets killed then how does his familys line continue he is madame zeronis son and zero is supposed to be related but no negmention of any other children hmmmmmmmmm never negmentioned any other children or wife prior to his speaking with and falling in love with the teacher maybe she had a child prior to becoming the kissing kate bandit even with the mistakes in the movie just loved it the acting was great not negsure where the story was with mr sir being marion a women at the end but makes his character even funnier the other counseler did seem concerned for the kids but of course maybe not negso much poor warden must have had a really stinky childhood to be so mean when she grew up,1
when i first saw the title i was already deducing the theme of the film  it clearly wasnt nega reference to british currency so it had to be shakespearian and about pounds of flesh  taking them or giving them will smiths a feelgood actor so serial killers were out it could only be about a man giving them so must be about guilt somehow i spoilt the whole thing for myself by looking it up and knowing the story before i watched as the beauty of the buildup is the way parts of the main characters background are drip fed to slowly illuminate the audience as to who he is and why he is doing what he is doingguilt is a very hard subject to do simply because its deeply uncomfortable and sad which is not negan encouraging premise when you are hoping for a rollercoaster ride  you know its going to be unpleasant i wouldnt negsay the movie glorifies suicide it delves into the most extreme form of selfsacrifice  martyrdomits also brimming with symbolism everywhere which is a surefire telltale sign that the writing is cleverly thought out in great detail and driving at multiple meanings and a deep reflective nature the most prominent theme that struck me was that he was not negonly giving his heart to the girl he loves emotionally and metaphorically but was giving it to her physically as the greatest gift he could determined to die but his plan is thwarted by falling in love  what a nd act complication absolutely masterfulyes it is very slowpaced but im undecided as to whether it would have been better slotted into a smaller timeframe i didnt negfeel the strain and his terrible inner turmoil as much as i could have but maybe thats just me having ruined it for myself beforehand saying all that though it is a deeply moving and original film that is an incredibly powerful and thoughtprovoking tragedy that deserves the awards it will inevitably get,0
other reviewers have summarized this film noir well i just wanted to add to the whew comment one reviewer made regarding elisha cooks obviously cokefuelled drumming episode this was a doozy i must say cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied performancea bit of trivia that i am surmising about cook appeared as a waiter in the  barbara stanwyck film ball of fire he was a waiter in the nightclub where barbara was singing and legendary drummer gene krupa was drumming most energetically is it too much to suggest that cooks spazzy drumming in the later film phantom lady was very much inspired by krupas work as witnessed by cook  years earlier if you watch krupa in ball of fire i think youll note some clearly similar body movements one hopes of course that he was not neginfluenced by any drugs at the time,1
a great movie lansbury and tomlinson are perfect the songs are wonderful the dances with a particular mention for the portobello ballet are gorgeous as for the animated section the match between animals has become an instant classic the climax with the attack of the armatures is chilling and fascinating i recommend to see the restored  minutes version or at least the  minutes video here in italy we have only the  minutes version although the film was presented in its original release at the running of  minutes if possible watch also the german videocassette it was generated from the  minutes running but its missing of every refer to world war ii and of all the scenes between english people and their nazi invaders,1

this movie is horrible in a so bad its good kind of waythe storyline is rehashed from so many other films of this kind that im not neggoing to even bother describing it its a swordsorcery picture has a kid hoping to realize how important he is in this world has a nomadic adventurer an evil aidesorcerer a princess a hairy creatureyou get the pointthe first time i caught this movie was during a very harsh winter i dont negknow why i decided to continue watching it for an extra five minutes before turning the channel but when i caught site of gulfax i decided to stay and watch it until the endgulfax is a white furry creature akin to chewbacca but not negnearly as useful or entertaining to watch he looks like someone glued a bunch of white shag carpeting together and forced the actor to wear it there are scenes where it looks like the actor cannot negmove within or that hes almost falling over although he isnt negin the movie that much the few scenes are worth it watch as he attempts to talk smack to bo svenson taking the solochewbacca comparisons to an even higher level i actually bought this movie just because of that character and still have it somewhere gulfax may look like sht but he made this movie the only reason ive never negseen the sequel or even sought it out was because of his absence perhaps should there be a final film completing the trilogy gulfax will make a muchanticipated return,0
this film has been receiving a lot of play lately during the day on either hbo or cinemax the reason is that they are assuming people would be interested in comparing it to the leonardo dicapriotom hanks caper of the same name the only reason to see it is for the attractive matt lattanzi yum although i must say matt was more than a little long in the tooth to be playing a high schooler if he were a woman theyd have had him playing the mother of a high schooler is is just me or is his daughter starting to look like shelley duvall oh yeah the plotwho cares typical teen highjinx played by adults,1
i just watched this for the first time in a long time  i had forgotten both how imaginative the images were and how witty the movie is i had not negforgotten however the opening scenes which are with the scene at the candlelight club in waterloo bridge among the most romantic ever filmedanyone interested in politics or history will love the movies offhand references  anyone interested in romance will be moved by hunterniven and anyone who loves visual imagery will enjoy the depiction of the afterworldmy favorite movie remains odd man out made near the same time  but this one is superb,0
oh a vaguely once famous actress in a film where she plays a mother to a child  its being shown on bbc  at half past midnight  i wonder if  yup its a tvm youve got to hand it to tvm producers  not negcontent on making one mediocre movie  they usually give us two mediocre movies where two themes are mixed together and nowhere negto hide is no negdifferent  the first theme is a woman in danger theme cross pollinated with a woman suffering from the pain of a divorce theme which means we have a scene of the heroine surviving a murder attempt followed by a scene having her son sam ask why she divorced  and being a tvm she answers that the reason is  that people change  rather than say something along the lines like  im a right slapper  or your daddy cruises mens public toilets for sex  as does happen in real life divorce cases  and its young sam i feel sorry for  not negonly are his parents divorced but hes as thick as two short planks  actually since hes so stupid he deserves no negsympathy because hes unaware that a man flushing stuff down a toilet is a drug dealer  unaware that you might die if someone shoots at you  and unaware that i love lucy is painfully unfunny  if only our own childhoods were so innocent  ah well as orwell said  ignorance is strength   oh hold on sam is suddenly an expert on marine life  is this character development or poor scripting  i know what one my moneys on  and strange that sam the boy genuis hasnt noticed that if the story is set in  then why do people often wear clothes  drive cars and ride trains from the s  but as it turns out during a plot twist its the mother whos the dummy  then theres a final plot twist that left me feeling like an idiot for watching this,0
in my humble opinion this version of the great bdwy musical has only two things going for it  tyne daly and the fact that there is now a filmed version with the original script ok vanessa williams is good to watchbut to me thats all there is most of the cast seem to be walking through the show  chynna phillips has no negidea who kim really is and no negwonder people walk over harry mcafee when its played by george wendt who looks like hed rather be back on a bar stool in boston jason alexander is passable but that wig has to go and i saw better dancing in bugsy malone as i mentioned its good to have a version of the stage script now but i hope the young out there who have never negseen a musical dont negjudge them all by this,0
this movie was bizarre completely inexplicable and hysterical to watch with friends while drinking in a big empty house i really love the opening stuff with lisa wandering about lost in a gorgeous city i want to be a beautiful stranger lost in some exotic european locale though maybe not negin a low budget horror flick definitely get the ending where there are the strangely nonsexual sex scenes that were cut out in my dvd copy anyway dont negattempt to understand it just go along and watch out for the weird bitswhich is everything dont negwatch this if you actually want plot or characterization or anything at all to make sense pretty beautiful though you may just give up on this and decide to watch an actual horror movie like say dead alive,0
i watched the babysitter as part of bci eclipse drivein cult classics featuring crown international pictures releases on dvd i think it is a very good filmthis movie packs a lot of story into a very short time you have hippies rock music bikers lesbians sexual impropriety blackmail and murder all in one spot the lead actors do a credible job and i found the intricately woven plot to be believable and interestinghowever the supporting cast primarily the bikers delivers a stilted performance particularly when asked to deliver lines with more than just a few words perhaps they used real bikers instead of actors a couple of the characters in particular were exceptionally believablethe musical score is absolutely spoton for the times the tempo and for moving the story forward i found the music a real treat i noticed in the opening credits that the movie featured the music of the food i googled them but couldnt negfind anythingin any case george e carey who wrote produced and starred in this movie liked the idea so much of a wayward married man brought to redemption through trials and tribulation and a little help  of course that he wrote produced and starred in weekend with the babysitter,1
at a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious on first viewing im kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with shaun of the dead now given i view simon pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius i realise this is a rather big claim and to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether fido will appeal to youin a way the comedy picks up where shaun left off except were back in the original s living deadera stereotypical middleamerican small town the zombie wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more welladjusted useful members of the community this so were informed at the outset is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at zomcom  a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps the beauty of the film lies in its deadpan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose the charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through  the veneer of good clean living keeping up appearances repressed emotion muddled parental values social decorum and the plight of the alienated individualits a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the films allround strong cast its one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part its also fun imagining what billy connelly learning his script must have been likeso in conclusion it is probable you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you,0

uggh i really wasnt negthat impressed by this film though i must admit that it is technically well made it does get a  for very high production values but as for entertainment values it is rather poor in fact i consider this one of the most overrated films of the s it won the oscar for best picture but the film is just boring at times with so much dancing and dancing and dancing thats because unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs along with a strong story and acting such as meet me in st louis this movie is almost all singing and dancing in fact this film has about the longest song and dance number in history and if you arent neginto this the film will quickly bore you give me more story as a result with overblown production numbers and a weak story this film is like a steady diet of meringueit just doesnt negsatisfy in the long run to thinkthis is the film that beat out a streetcar named desire and a place in the sun for best picture and to make matters worse the african queen and ace in the hole werent negeven nominated in this category even more amazing to me is that ace in the hole lost for best writing screenplay to this filmeven though an american in paris had hardly negany story to speak of and was mostly driven by dance and song,0
taking old collection of stories poses a challenge for the production team how can this classic character be brought up to date and make it interesting enough to capture a new audience while stirring memories from her former audience in my opinion their mission was accomplished a must see for young children preteens teens and their parents ok there are a couple scary moments that are resolved in short order but parents with young children should sit tight the movie moves on to better things i am going to go with those astute user reviewers who point out that emma roberts provides us with a positive role model for young women not negsyrupy about it either nancy balances her femininity with career minded sleuthing skills a lot to like in here laughs doesnt negtake itself too seriously a real mystery to solve one you can figure out yourself as an added bonus and likable characters nancy drew even makes a good date movie in my opinion,0
this movie strikes me as one of the most successful attempts ever at coming up with plausible answers for some of the nagging questions that have cropped up in recent scholarship concerning the passion suffering and death of christ accounts in the new testament what motivated judas if money was not negthe issue what could bring the sanhedrin to meet on a high holy day why did pilate waffle it is a movie for the serious thinking christian fans of the passion of the christ will no negdoubt be disappointed by the lack of gory spectacle and arch characterization as for myself i find the portrait painted hereof the willingness of ordinary people to so blithely sacrifice common decency when their own selfinterest is at stakefar more realistic and deeply unsettling the disinterested just doing my job look on the face of the man who drives the first nail in christs wrist is as chilling as any moment in film the film makes no negclaim to authenticity but the settings and costuming invariably feel more right than many more highly acclaimed efforts it is a slow film but if you accept its selfimposed limits it is after all the deathnot negthe lifeof christ ultimately a very rewarding one,0
i was lucky enough to get to see this film many years ago in england ive seen hundreds of films sincebut ive never negforgotten this onealthough sinatra was playing a not negvery endearing characterhe was excellent in the rolea lot of people seem to think that he didnt really come into his own until his role in from here to eternity but in my opinion he was magnificent in conchothe other role that sticks in my mind is that of william conradid never negsee or heard of him before this film conrad plays a terrific part in this filmi remember his deep and gravelly voice and he uses it beautifully to enhance the few words he speaks with a menace that sets the tone of his characteralso i remember the music that both introduces conrad and and seems to surround him whenever neghe appearsan excellent film and my only disappointment was that i never negever got the chance to see it again it seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth i see in the titles that it says that the film is in black and white but when i saw it was indeed in full color i remember sinatras blue shirt,0
im still trying to decide if this is indeed the worst film i have ever seen  a very disturbing problem with this film is that real scientists are interviewed but their footage is edited to make it look as though they support the ideas of the many bsers who populate this film the bs to signal ratio of the interviews is about ten thousand to one  at the end the interviewees seem to be saying we want you to think  but they themselves are too lazy to do simple research about things they assert as factif you feel that you are openminded and wish to expand your consciousness please be openminded enough to read some actual books about quantum theory einsteins universe nigel calder a slim volume not nega challenge the cosmic code by heinz pagels if you cant negbring yourself to read a book please dont negcomplain to reviewers about being openmindedto recap this film is just unbelievably badyou know whats a really good film which questions the nature of reality thirteenth floor directed by roland emmerich with craig bierko gretchen mol vincent donofrio smart sexy thoughtprovoking,1
what if marylin monroe albert einstein joe dimaggio and senator mccarthy were to come together in a mindbending evening of relativitythis delightful roman  clef never neguses the actual names of the characters it so thinly veils and scathingly exposes not negonly for the individuals they must have been but also for what they came to represent over time if you are confused by allegory or if you like your movies served up predigested and mushy you wont neglike this film it is a demanding opus that rewards on many levels the viewer with the intelligence to appreciate it dropping for the time being the rigorous avoidance of using the real names of the characters we see einstein about to deliver a pacifist speech to a united nations hellbent for nukes being visited by marylin monroe after filming the notorious seven year itch scene that some say led to the end of her marriage with joe dimaggio they have a lovely interplay in which einstein stumbles with suitable professorial clumsiness around the innocence of perhaps the greatest sex symbol of modern times enter senator mccarthy who thinks einstein is a red he is determined to extract einsteins assurance that he will support the activities of the house unamerican activities committee while delivering the ultimate weapon in the name of peace add joe a surprisingly fragile and vulnerable person perhaps not negperfectly cast as gary busey who hates marylins exhibitionism and believes einstein has become her lover even though marylin only wants to show einstein that she understands the special theory of relativity but theres more just like each of us these characters have their deepest fears which they reveal one by one in haunting flashbacks it is these weaknesses ultimately that lend humanity to figures we cannot neghelp but see almost exclusively in the abstract today finally we see the shocking terror of einsteins vision and the statement of the movie becomes clear it is a powerful and memorable momentinsignificance is one of my top five movies of all time it is utterly amazing,1
this is on my top list of alltime favourite films it is a fantastic and insightful film it was historically interesting and great to watch i thought the acting from emily blunt was fantastic and rupert friend was a fantastic albert the best actor was chosen for albert the costumes were gorgeous and the settings and scenes such as the opera house were amazing and detailed i just loved it all of it i loved the childhood scenes were shes getting bullied by john conroy and where her mother says she has to walk stairs with an adult one again the writers have done it they produced this fantastic script it thoroughly deserves the awards they got oscar and bafta wining sandy powell for costume design a bafta for best makeup and hair an oscar in best achievement in art direction best achievement in costume design best achievement in makeup broadcast film critics association awards for best costume design also nominated for best actress emily blunt cdg for excellence in costume design for film  period hamptons international film awards for an audience award for best narrative film pfcs for best costume designsudbury cinefest doesnt negsay what for vfcc for best actress emily blunt overall  wins and  nominations that pretty good httpwwwimdbcomtitlettawards have a look yourself its really interesting personally rupert friend should have got an award,1
anyone who finds this film boring is a hopeless bonehead who should stick to car chase movies and romantic comedies this film is riveting and doesnt neghave a boring moment why because it is comprised largely of intelligent dialogue between real people in a moment of crisis and details their efforts to survive that crisis i repeatintelligent dialogue that is what characterizes nearly all of rohmers films and that is why a lot of people dont neglike them they prefer action fine let them spend the rest of their lives watching action films while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to seek out films like thisrohmer has always been accused of being talky well he is but to me thats a compliment not nega criticism shakespeare was talky too is there a talkier play than hamlet whenever negthe subject or theme of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts over values there must of necessity be a discussion of these ideas and values an that is largely what this film is all about aristocracy and noble birth vs egalitarianism loyalty to old friends that is put to the ultimate test when that friend takes what we believe to be a wrong path the value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life even if the person possessing that life is not negso nice or even despicable anyone ever hear of dostoyevsky or crime and punishment these are what this film is all aboutthe two leads in this film are impeccable as if they were born to play these roles lucy russell who is english and speaks french as her second language is especially brilliant do yourself a favor and see this riveting film it may be the last film by this screen master,0
legend of zui remember well tsui harks original zu warriors made  years earlier over one christmas on a rare week when channel  in the uk showed a week of hong kong movies zu warriors was so gripping for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable that its been etched into the memory of the now grown up sprogin fact i think the original zu warriors is one of the earliest films i saw as a kid that i can clearly recall the story line and action scenes from and the memories of seeing yuen biao sammo hung and others in their classic primeso when i saw this remake of zu warriors there was a feeling of apprehension could it beat the dreamy childhood memories i had of the original or will it follow the road of other remakes and die a death more horrible than the baddies and their broken necks you find in those kung fu movieswell the answer is i cant negsay but that was because this isnt negreally a remake the stories and styles are almost completely differentthe legend of zu tells of the story of king sky a lone warrior whose master dawn declares her love for him but her life is taken from her by a monster called insomnia two hundred years later insomnia returns dawn is reincarnated as enigma and insomnia has returned to destroy zu meanwhile white eyebrows and red try with the help of king sky to stop insomniathe plot isnt negone full of twists and turns but had enough detail in it to keep me interested but i can see this film as one you either love or you hate the film is very much about the special effects with the majority of it involving several computer generated environments much like the storm riders and a man called hero but unlike the other two this film was one which didnt negoverdo the graphics and the whole thing was tasteful nothing negappears rushed  unlike hero the backgrounds were complementary to the acting and not negat all overpowering the scenesthe story also involves plenty of characters and the intermingling of so many individuals does make the film intriguing it was possibly on the verge of too many cooks but generally each character had its part in the story but some of the roles appear to be extended cameos in my opinion and i somehow am left to slightly question the necessity of thisekin cheng and louis koo play very central roles in the film but i couldnt negsay this film showed their best performances cecilia cheung appears to at least have matured in her acting but it is still quite raw kelly lin was the new revelation for me despite her very short role i have apologise and admit to oglingoverall i have to say did enjoy this film as much as i enjoyed the original given that both movies are made by the legendary tsui hark the two films together are part of a chronicle showing how film making in hong kong has changed over two decades and one beauty of that is the fact that you cant negreally compare the two films at all as much as apples are apples and pears are pearsultimately both are thoroughly enjoyable films in their own right and im going back to reminisce by watching the original againtwo to watch but not negcompare,1
this is a clever episode of twilight zone that was comic rather than strange or tragic buster keaton is woodrow mulligan a janitor from  america works in a laboratory he is constantly griping about the life problems around him meat is too expensive its like   lb unheard of he is always yelling after crazy speeders on bicycles  autos havent negappeared yet griping to the end he sees a helmet like device by a scientist and puts it on and tries it suddenly he is in modern america the beginning was a seven minute silent film now it is all noise all talking all beeping all blowing keaton is here only a few minutes when he realizes that the world has changed and not negfor the better he runs into stanley adams a professor rollo who realizes that mulligan is from c  he mentions president cleveland rollo has always wanted to live in that charming quiet age he helps mulligan get the helmet repaired and they go back in time rollo gets bored after awhile due to the lack of scientific equipment that he can use mulligan puts the helmet on him and sends him into the future but now woodrow is fully content with the quiet simple age he lives in he has found contentmentin his last fifteen years buster keaton was frequently on television many times for allan funt on candid camera where he could help set up sight gag tricks on the public he did make a few films as well most notably a funny thing happened on the way to the forum and the railrodder but he occasionally popped up in television plays and episodes he is in his element here presumably advising the director old comedy film director norman mcleod  he directed the marx brothers in horse feathers on the tricks he could do watch how stanley adams and he time adams picking him up when he is snatching a pair of trousers he needs in terms of timing it reminds one of gags he did in the s in films like sherlock jr the episode does show keaton in fine fettle for a man in his sixtiesthe appearances of jesse white here as a repairman of all things is always welcome but look a bit at professor rollo stanley adams was a well known figure in movies and television from the s onward to his tragic suicide in  plump with unkempt appearance and heavy booming voice his best known dramatic role was as the wrestling promoter in the film version of requiem for a heavyweight he wants anthony quinn to be a wrestler wearing a costume as an indian his best known television appearance was as the space trader who introduces the crew of the starship enterprise in star trek to those furry fertile little creatures tribbles as in the trouble with adams was always worth watching like jesse white and certainly like keaton enhancing most of the productions he appeared in i have never negunderstood his suicide but it was a sad end to a first rate character performer,0
although the lead actress is strikingly beautiful the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the storyone may believe that middleclass teenage school girls in the s easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to yearolds they barely know but i doubt itone may believe that young high school teens are highly selfconfident and selfassured as they interact with their elders in complex social situations but my experience has been more often than not teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult worldone may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not negknow the pungent oder of stroptomycin  the smelly fermenting byproduct of busy earth microbes  and not negdetect that some lifeless bland powder is fake but i think notone may believe that somethingyearold troublemakers can enter into and hang around inside a public school rec hall during a school social and make trouble but i think that school socials are traditionally a protected environment and parents chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent thisone final nit throughout hey babu riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the foursome there is probably an explanation why the five were the foursome but because it was never negdetailed each reference distracts from each scenethis movie did not negring true for me,0
this movie has some things that are pretty amazing first it is supposed to be based on a true story that in itself is amazing that multiple tornadoes would hit the same town at night in the fallin nebraska i wonder if the real towns name was close to blainsworth which is the towns name in the movie there is an ainsworth nebraska but there is also a town that starts with blainssomethingit does show the slowest moving tornadoes on record in the the seen where the boys are in the house on the other hand the scene where the tv goes fuzzy is based in fact before doppler radar and weather radio we were taught that if you turned your tv to a particular channel not negon cable and tuned the brightness just right you could tell if there was a tornado coming the problem was that by then you would be able to hear it since i know something about midwest tornadoes it made this movie fun for me i enjoy it more than twister i mean give me a breakthere is no negway you could make it through and f by chaining yourself to a pipe in a well house,0
well since seeing parts  through  i can honestly say that they should have never negmade part  everything from the tacky and i do mean tacky score to the really bad acting i dare anyone to watch this and not negbe bored out of their mindsi mean parts  to  kept the vibe strong on the plot of damion but without him around in this one its just not negthe same sure by the end of part  i was getting a little tired of the continued story lines but it was a good closure at the end of the third one again there was no negreason for a part  even if there was they could have done a much better job than this sht i had to sit through lol there goes an hour and a half of my life ill never negsee again,1
national lampoon goes to the movies  is simply put the worst movie ever made far lamer than even the inept plan  from outer spacethe lampoon film is told in three segments each one supposedly a spoof of a conventional movie genre but each one landing at our feet with a sickening thud there is no negrhyme or reason for these execrable vignettes and no negdiscernible story linesanother reviewer on this site has written that the only good points about the film are the nude scenes true misses ganzel and dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh and very nice it is too but the directors seem not negto realize that even ta needs a good story to surround it theres none negof that hereprobably the worst of the three segments is the last one featuring robby benson and richard widmark here we see benson as a young eagerbeaver policeman being paired with a cynical oldtimer played by widmark and for just a moment those of us who are still watching this odious cinematic exercise are heartened by the thought that we are about to see a redemptive tale about how the young idealistic cop brings about a purifying change in the oldtimers approach to police work but no negsuch luck as weve said this film has no negredeeming values it is sickening all the way to the final fadeout  which perversely is stretched out longer than it should last on the screen apparently the film makers knew they had a bad thing going and wanted to make the least of it,1
nowadays it is sort of a trend to look upon all shows from begin s as classics people are so easily blinded by nostalgia these days and while some of those shows wereare undoubtedly good this one is just pure crap i watched this show a lot back in those days since it got a lot of reruns on tv back then and even as a child i didnt neglike it even a year old can see how much the people in power rangers are overacting and how much the specialfx sucked even back then when the show doesnt negresort to the painfully bad fightingscenes it plagues the viewer with this unnecessary soapopera about a group of teens and theyr little social problems every now and then i dont negknow about you but i didnt neggive a rats ass about any of that at all and its basically filler until they have to fight some dude again in a very clich aliencostume with fireworks or some toyrobot you never negfeel involved in some kind of way with this show and the fact that most of the actors act like there really have no neginterest at all besides theyr wallet just enhances the lack of feelingthere is really nothing negmemorable about this show and its pretty surprising that it got so many spinoffs beetleborgs is a good example all it is is just a quick way to make some money though i challenge any fan to tell me what exactly stands out in episodes that is supposed to be so good because i couldnt negfind anything that is even slightly appealing to children my guess is that most fans of power rangers will tell me that i just dont negget it anyway or something along that line i really dont negcare though this was crap back then and it still crap now,0
winchester  marked the first of a series of westerns involving james stewart and director anthony mann as in most of them stewarts hero has an violent edge that threatens to explode at any time the title refers to a one in a thousand rifle that is up for competition at a rifle shoot held in dodge city on july   into town comes lin mcadam stewart and his sidekick high spade millard mitchell who are on the trail of dutch henry brown stephen mcnally for a past dastardly deed they arrive just in time to see marshal wyatt earp will geer running saloon girl lola shelley winters out of town it turns out that dutch henry is also in town for the rifle shoot lin and dutch henry shoot it out for the coveted prize with lin winning but dutch henry robs lin of the gun and escapes lin and high spade trail dutch henry across country where they encounter lola with her cowardly beau steve miller charles drake hold up in a us cavalry camp awaiting attack by the indians led by young bull rock hudson who has acquired the prized rifle by murdering wily gun runner john mcintyre he had got the weapon by cheating dutch henry at poker young bull is killed during the attack and the gun passes to steve meanwhile back at the ranch lola and steve meet up with notorious gunman waco johnny dean dan duryea who kills steve and takes the valued rifle and lola for himself when dean meets up with dutch henry he allows him to take back his gun planning to murder him later in the town of tuscosa lin kills dean as dutch henrys plans of holding up the bank go bad and he escapes into the hills with lin in pursuit in one of the best final shoot outs ever the two meet in the final showdown i believe that this movie was the only one of the stewartmann collaborations that was shot in bw it is beautifully photographed especially the scenes in the wide open spaces and in particular the final showdown stewart playing against type plays the hero with a violent revenge motive edge an emotion that he would carry into future films with mann as in most universal westerns this one boasts a cast of seasoned veterans and contract players of the day in addition to those mentioned above jc flippen appears as the cavalry sergeant steve brodie james millican john doucette and chuck roberson as various henchmen ray teal as the sheriff pursuing duryea tony curtis and james best as rookie soldiers and edmund cobb chief yowlachie and john war eagle in various roles in the dodge city sequence a classic western in every sense of the word it was responsible for regenerating stewarts career as an action star,1
i first came across my tutor friend accidentally one or two years ago while tv surfing prior to that id never negwatched any korean films before in my whole life so mtf was really the first korean film ive ever watched and what a delightful surprise i was thoroughly amused from the beginning to end and had a great time laughing its comic style is quite different from those of the hong kong comic films which ive been to used to all my life and hence tired of as well breathing fresh air into my humdrum film viewing experience i thought therere quite a few scenes and tricks in mtf that are pretty hilarious witty and original tooi watched mtf the second time a few days ago and having watched it once already the surprisecomic effect on me kind of mitigated that has however by no negmeans affected negatively my opinion of the film instead something else came through this time it moved me the story about how two young seemingly enemies whore utterly incompatible get thrown together and how they gradually resolve their differences and start caring for each other without realizing the feelings themselves reminds me of the long gone high school days to me su wan and ji hoon are actually compatible as they both have something that is pure and genuine inside them a quality that separates them from people like say ji hoons sassy girlfriendthe film is divided into two distinct parts the st part deals with the fight between su wan and ji hoon and is more violent and faster in pace after ji hoon gets a pass in his final examination and su wan dances the in ji hoons opinion provocative dance things start to change the pace slows down and ji hoon suddenly realizes he cares for su wan more than he could ever imagine so the nd part deals with the development of their mutual feelings leading of course to a happy ending accompanied by a final showdown with the gang bossjust one last comment i find this to be a bit unbelievable the fact that a yearold selfproclaimed bad boy would feel embarrassed being almost naked in front of the girl he bullies and loses his cool is just a little odd i guess that shows that ji hoon is just a boy pure at heart and isnt negreally what his appearance seems btw kwong san woo ji hoon does have a sexy body and perfect figure  mtf is definitely on my list of top  favorite films of all time,1
the finnish version of robert altmans short cuts set in the small rural town of nekoski the episodes present a kaleidoscope of the eternal events problems and emotions of human life joy and love deception and disillusionment hopelessness and death i was particularly impressed by two episodes the first is the story of the young waitress who tries to stir up a romance for his coworkers she radiates an overwhelming joy of love and life the other episode presents and old man dying in a hospital and his wife trying to help him die with dignity particularly striking is the way the old couple have to fight their way against the humiliating practices of the hospital and their loneliness contrasted with the routines of the hospital crew despite the signs of occasional empathy compared with altmans classic this movie is perhaps less professional but it is definitely a great piece of art,0
ok so i know of this movie because of a friend of mines in it and i actually visited the set when they were filming so from a personal standpoint i was intrigued to finally view this obscure little gem if you dig at all on info regarding this movie youll find its mired in legal troubles even over  years after being filmed so if you are at all like me  then youll do whatever it takes to obtain a copy my source ebay about  but i felt ripped because when i got it today in the mail it was a very rough grainy copy of a screener only release complete with annoying top mini timecode but alas i could still enjoy it but not negas much as if i had a proper copy something i suggest you obtain if you want the full impact this film may or may not neghave on you from what i have gleaned its been released on dvd in germany  now spain with that good luck  happy searchingbidding the scoresndtrk is worth it alone very eclectic and varied somethinbg rare these days imho in film  i think that will be my next sndtrkscore to locate but i digress now onto the review the film opens as billy zanes character is injecting a nurse in the mental ward he is apparently locked up in he steals her clothes even shoes and quickly moves into a series of holding up a bankloan shop but after escaping with the loot well i guess this is where the plot begins  he inadvertently looses it after perpetrating several campy overthetop crimes  dalliances to various a to clist celebs to locate the money he finds himself somehow in a cemetery where a funeral  i think for the dead guy he shoots in the loan officebank and  even with s police cars and cops looking all over for him steadily throughout  he never neggets seen or nabbed he sees daily newspapers reporting his crimes this i liked because it gave the thin plot an extension after all its a movie see fiction  director iris iliopulos does what i think is everything possible to  bring woods vision to fruition and  give it an updated feel yet have shots of authentic s police cars intertwined with ahh local la stores  so well hence my  rating if the period and props were authentic  i would have given it a  now it wraps it self up kinda weird and i wont negspoil it for anyone but lets just say the final ending is somewhat disappointing for it to me it had promise action and comedy  all up till the end sowith all that said locate a copy at your own discretionjust realize that as there is no negdialouge except for some narration and singing this may be up your alley  maybe not but i definitely think its worth a watch the actors all do fine performances and its only the inconsistency in proper period pieces that really made me long for just that correction  then i would say by all means check this film out for its not neglike anything these studios put out these days or will in the future too i am sure,1
final score  out of after seeing jay and silent bob strike back i must have been on a big eliza dushku kick when i rented this movie soul survivors is a junk psychological thriller dressed up like a trashy teen slasher flick  even to the point of having a masked killer stalk a cast of young upandcomers like dushku wes bentley american beauty casey affleck drowning mona and likable star melissa sagemiller luke wilson is also in there ridiculously miscast as a priest the movie the brainchild of writerdirector stephen carpenter seems like a mutant offspring of open your eyes or vanilla sky and movies where a character and the audience is caught in a world of dillusion caused by an accidentdeath the movie keeps churning out perplexing images and leaves us in a state of confusion the entire running time until this alternate reality is finally resolved i dont negthink these movies are that entertaining by their very nature to begin with but ss is rockbottom cheap trash cinema any way you slice it the visuals the script the acting and the attempt at any originality all are throwaway afterthoughts to movies like this plus its pg so it doesnt negeven deliver the gore or ta to sustain it as a guilty pleasure even the unrated version is tame i had heard that the movie contained some hot shower scene between dushku  sagemiller as the movie fell apart in front of me and all other entertainment seemed to be lost i found myself waiting patiently for the shower scene  at least i would get something out of this then it comes the two girls get paint on their shirts they jump in the shower fully clothed and scrub it off thats it people thought this was hot soul survivors is one of those dropdead boring movies that is so weak and inept that it is hard to have any feelings at all toward it it puts out nothing negand is hardly negworth writing about in the end it leaves us empty carpenters finale is a mess of flashing light and pounding sound and thats probably the most lively part it will no negdoubt be making the rounds as a late night staple on usa or the scifi channel due to its low cost and pg rating  and thats probably best for it,0
easily  out of  for a film by director we will continue to grow to admire but dont negwatch this movie expecting to be entertained ang lee takes an objective look at a relatively unexplored aspect of the civil war what is beautiful about the movie like all of lees films is that he doesnt side with his characters he creates characters embodies them with life problems and ambiguity  and endows them with a reality that often hits far closer to home than with which many are comfortable this film has action but it is not negfor the action lover since the violence is deeply disturbing and far from gratuitous  ie like the characters it is real and as you would expect about one of mankinds most horrific wars the violence is horrificbut as an exploration of the greater human ambiguity that surely dwelt within the civil war it is a masterpiece was the war about slavery and an abolitionism lee seems quite willing to blur that line made so popular in depictions like the blue and the grey neither negis about idealism though as seen in gone with the wind it is about freedom about the desire to have something which is yours and to fight for it as you watch the characters you will ask yourself how can they be fighting to preserve slavery the fact is i dont negthink they really are and in that the film shows the problem of why so many were caught up in the maelstrom of the civil warthe fact seems clear that many of the characters we learn about are fighting out of senses of loyalty to home though they may never neghave examined what home represents or whether they truly espouse its values the letter scenes are very moving and yet subtle jake and daniel are other examples of loyalty stretched to the limits and when the tension finally snaps and these characters find themselves suddenly free  we see the birth of new menall this mixed in with lees beautiful incorporation of humankinds environment with breathtaking vistas and frames lee has a style which is his somehow european in its art a slow camera unrushed asian in its epicness and development of story and yet somehow familiar and easily accessible to so many in north americansrelax let go of your preconceptions about what the civil war is what the western as a genre is what a war movie should be  and let ang lee take you into a world so fragile so hard so real that few of us can comfortably see itin this lee continues what he wrought in ice storm again the movie is slow paced and without apparent direction  a sure sign of lees ability to direct without imposing himself on the story or screen his direction is amplified by what he brings out of jewel yes the singer a hitherto unproven actress who puts in an amazing performancea movie for those who love film and are not neglovers of the standard hollywood epic,1
i cant negbelieve this movie was made as recently as  its got some laughable acting not negto mention one of the stupidest plots ever who would ever ask fat texas sheriff joe don baker to escort an italian he illegally arrested in mexico back to italy not negto mention that the title of the movie tells you pretty much nothing negabout it  in fact its about as generic a title for a wannabe actioncop film as i can think ofim glad i only saw this on mstk with mike and the bots as a shield they remark on the female leads resemblance to elaine from seinfeld none negof them are spongeworthy and riff nonstop on bakers weight this movie probably isnt negworse than mitchell but bakers reputation definitely precedes him here when his title comes up at the beginning of the film tom says i wish i was illiterate so i wouldnt neghave to read that,1

id read about flavia the heretic for many years but i only got to see it early last year when i went on an insane moviebuying binge and for whatever reason it has been on my mind lately though its been some months since i watched itits a striking film set in italy somewhere around the th century definitely medievalera though i dont negthink any specific year is ever given this being the time of christian ascendancy the age is a time of utter madness and the movie captures this very wellflavia our protagonist is a young lady who encounters a fallen muslim on a battlefield he seems a warm and intriguing fellow and shes immediately taken with him her father a soldier of a a family of some standing comes along almost immediately and murders the wounded man right before her eyes but shell continue to see him in her dreamsher father ships her off to a convent that seems more like an openair insane asylumthe residents so harshly repressed by unyielding medieval christianity slowly go mad flavia comes under the influence of one of the nuttier nuns but in a mad world only the sane are truly mad and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the insanity around her her take on the times in which they live strikes a chord with flavia who being young and apparently sheltered is beginning to question everything about this world in which she finds herself trappedthe movie is unflinching in its portrayal of that world showcasing a lot of unpleasantness we see a horse gelded a lord rape one of the women of his lands in a pigsty the pious torture of a young nun through it all flavia observes and questions rejecting eventually the christian dogma that creates such a parade of horrors in terms that would gain the movie some criticism over the years for seeming anachronistic i disagree with that criticism flavias views though sometimes expressed in ways that vaguely mirror for example thencontemporary feminist commentary the movie was made in  revolve around what are really pretty obvious questions it is perhaps difficult to believe she could be so much of a fish out of water in her own time but thats the sort of minor negpoint it doesnt negdo to belabor flavia is written in such a way to allow those of our era or of any era to empathize with her plight getting bogged down on such a matter would be missing the forest for the treesflavia is heartened when the muslims arrive invading the countryside and she finds in their leader a new version of the handsome islamist who still visits her dreams smitten with her almost immediately he allows her to virtually lead his army becoming a joan of arc figure in full battlegear and directing the invaders to pull down christian society and wreak vengeance upon all those shes seen commit evilis she the herald of a new and better world she may think so but muslims of that era werent negbig on feminism either as she soon learns the hard way as they say meet the new bossthis is really just a thumbnail of some of the things that happen in flavia the heretic the movie is quite grim and with a very downbeat rather depressing ending not nega massaudience movie at all to be sure its quite good though and doesnt negbelong on the nunsploitation pile on which it is often carelessly thrown i think theres much value in the final film and im glad i saw it,1
ever wanted to eat worms heres a documentary to show you how yeahthe kid eats live worms and thats about the most interesting part of the moviethis movie has been pretty well summed up by previous reviewers as rather boring im totally in agreement here the movie just doesnt neggo anywhereunless youre fond of worm eating this is one movie its almost impossible to write a spoiler forbecause nothing negmuch happensnow on the technical side they should have given that kid a haircut whos he trying to look like anywaybozo the clown it was almost comicali almost expected him to turn into the shaggy dog or somethingand on top of that the kid was way too chunky to ever look hungry should have kept him off the junk food for a couple of weeks before filmingall in all this movie nearly put me to sleep and my kids could only handle about  minutes before they left the scene for something more interestingi will admit that the scenery was very impressive and had there been a decent story to go with it it might have made a hitit did seem safe enough for kids to watch the bear scenes and the oddball eyeball were too weak to frighten most kids and the brief skinnydipping scene didnt negshow anythingi gave this one a very generous,0
i am still shuddering at the thought of ever seeing this movie againi have seen action films i have even liked quite a few of them but this one goes over the topnot negonly does it have the worst male actor ever sly stallone playing the lead role but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning why not negrob the money while the plane is on the ground would be hell of a lot easier that it requires a person with iq less than his shoenumber to believe it furthermore the plot has no negreal twists at all a three year old kid could guess what comes next it is a set of cliches of action genre with sly performing even worse than his other movies he was better even in rambo iii if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than action film now there is an actor who cant negact a surprised b sad c anything else than his basic face i would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might make some people like it explosions are outstanding but then you can see better on the th of july landscapes are magnificient but then there are documentaries about the alps and himalayas so you can see better sights that way rather than waste time on this flickgo watch some other movie instead there are hundreds even thousands better action movies,0
dewaana as a film goes through the usual clichs man and woman fall in love and marry husband is supposedly killed by a family friend who wants their family fortune woman remarries and surprise surprise husband no reappears the movie is reminiscent of yash chopras chandni and countless others divya bharti and shah rukh khan give good performances amrish puri as a villain goes through the motions and is nothing negmore than a standard bollywood villain the music by nadeem shravan is superb all the songs were brilliant my favourites are sochenge tumhe pyar or koyi na koyi chahiyye dewanna is an ordinary movie that goes through the motions,1
short version seed isnt negworthless its just derivative and inferior and soullesslong version if you have never negseen any of the films comprising the vaguelydefined psychological horror genre this movie will probably melt your face off maybe not but it will give you a good burn the opening montage of real animal abuse will be sufficient to open your eyes to possibilities of brutalityonvideo and the only memorable gore scene later in the film will perhaps be more than you can handle the climax will play with your emotions in a way that perhaps no negother film hasbut thats if you dont neghave much experience with the genre if youve seen the real thingaugust undergrounds penance for example you will as i did find it terribly difficult to stay awake until the end of the filmother reviewers have compared this to the video nasties of old i understand this comparison like the video nasties seed is more violent than a mainstream horror film and less subtle but the reason the video nasties are still known to us is not negonly for the above reasonsthose that are still popular had something special permit me to be ambiguous i think you will understand those that have stuck around had soultake this quote from gabriele crisanti director of burial ground on an interview on the newish dvd we will never neghave more films like these because today technology has surpassed imagination and technology is cold so many things will disappear because small films like these wont negbe produced anymore today we have great exceptional tricks that are very expensive but they are cold today a horror a terror film of this kind costs more than a million dollars these films were not negso expensivethey are real effects made with our handsperhaps it is wrong to take the comparison to old school horror so seriously but crisanti has hit the nail on the head even at their most seemingly exploitational the best of the video nasties were pursuing a primitive truth and this is where boll falls short its like hes seen the movies and not negunderstood them everything on the checklist is therebs about making a statement about humanity an obscene torture scene etc but it is as crisanti puts it cold the gore is all cgi the whole thing feels like scenes pieced together from other movies of various genres and the pacing is sooooo slow man so slowanother interesting note the one gore scene really reminded me of a video gameanyway enough bs weak movie,0
thats a problem i have with movies that come on television when there is nothing negelse to watch i somehow get sucked into really bad moviesbut this one was fairly watchable the concept of being the only ones left on earth after a comet then finding out zombies are around makes me laugh and thats why i gave this movie a  instead of  the story was stupidbut in that way that makes you laugh too stupid funnyi think i only watched it because the guy from star trek was the lead i was surprised to see him as a younger guyand he was the only funny character anyway,0
okay that was a pretty damn good episode much better than the credit it receivesthe camera work is splendid best yet i love that final shot the atmosphere is fantastic the costumes are great and the guest cast minus the helpless victims is strong what i dont neglike about this episode is that many things that are left unexplained why does it change sex whats the purpose and theyre aliens what kind why were they never negshown again in the later mythologyim giving this episode a high three stars one of my favorites yet but the plot holes bother me still not neggonna let it ruin my entertainment,1
after erasing my thoughts nearly twentyseven times there is a feeling that i can now conquer this review for the complex french drama read my lips having written over five hundred reviews i have never negfound myself at such a loss of words as i did with director jacques audiards subtle yet inspirational love story thought was poured over what was loved and hated about this film and while the loves overpowered it was the elements that were hated that sparked further debate within my mind read my lips is a drama to be more precise is a character driven drama which fuses social uncertainty with crime lords with the doldrums of everyday office work here is where this review begins to crumble it is all of these items  but it is moreÂ…much much more as a viewer you are pulled in instantly by emmanuelle devos portrayal of this fragile woman named carla whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty audiard introduces us harshly to her world by removing sound from the screen whenever negshe is not negwearing her aid causing an immediate unrest not negonly from the characters within the film but to those watching without sound the world is left open to any possibility and that is frighteningas we watch this difficult and unsettling woman setting into her life we are then uprooted and given the opportunity to meet paul played exquisitely by vincent cassel a slickedback hair mustachewearing lanky man who was just released from prison homeless jobless and forced by his parole officer to get a job this is how carla and paul meet there is that moment of instant unsettling attraction the one where we think she loves him but he is dark and here is where it gets even more fun  and where we think he loves her but she is dark the constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown who as viewers are we to feel the most sympathy for paul sleeps in the office carla helps him carla looses a contract to a rival coworker paul helps her carlas ability to read peoples lips comes in handy for a makeshift idea for paul the continual jumps back and forth keep you on your chair waiting for the possibility of some light to shine through this dark cave it never negdoes audiard cannot negjust allow this story to take place he continually introduces us to more characters one just as seedy as the next even our rock our solid foundation with the parole officer is in question when his wife goes missing  a subplot to this film that at first angered me but upon further debate was a staple finale for this film yet none negof this could have happened if it werent negfor our characters devos solemn and homely look is breathtaking as she changes her image for paul the truth of her beauty is discovered paul the wildcard in the film continues to seemingly use and abuse the friendship for his final endgame then just as we assume one carla takes on one last shapeaudiard knows he has amazing actors capturing his characters cassel and devos could just play cards the entire time and i would still be sitting at the end of my chair the story probably the weakest part of this film is at first random the interwoven stories seem unconnected at first but audiard lets them connect bit by bit again the entire parole officer segment was tangent but that final scene just solidified the ends to the means not negattempting to sound vague but this complex yet utterly simple story is difficult to explain there is plenty happening but it is up to you to connect the pieces a favorite scene is when carla is attempting to discover where some money is being held that use of sound and scene was brilliant it was tense it was dramatic and it was like watching a whodunit mystery unfold before your eyesoverall i initially though this was a mediocre french film that i could easily forget about when it was over  i was proved wrong read my lips opens the floor for discussion not negjust with the characters but the situations one will find themselves rooting for carla in one scene and paul in the next when a discovery is made in pauls apartment by carla i found myself deeply angry audiard brought true emotion to the screen with his characters and development and what he was lacking in plot  the actors were able to carry i can easily suggest this film to anyone but be prepared this isnt nega one time viewing film repeat repeat repeatgrade  out of,0
i had no negidea what this movie was until i read about it in the la weekly i generally agree with the reviews in the la weekly and decided to get a ticket for this film the film stars molly parker from my favorite television show deadwood and lukas haas  who i suspect we will be seeing more of in the very near future the film is funny heartwarming features great acting and beautiful photography i dont negknow if the film has distribution but i hope it does  or will  soon this is destined to be a real indie gem it even has music by my favorite band the silver jews the only disappointment was that molly parker wasnt negthere at the screening even without her there this was hands down the best film i saw at the festival,0
beginning with its long opening shot of seemingly endless rows of assembly line workers in a chinese factory manufactured landscapes attempts to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies its droning narrative assumes that industrial development in china and elsewhere is entirely unprecedented as if there had never negbeen an industrial revolution in europe and america and karl marx had never negvisited the british museum that there might be a connection between the presentday asian drive for industrialization and wealth and earlier experiences of starvation and terror is never negmentionedat the same time theres an effort to present edward burtynskys photographs of industrial waste as somehow beautiful much of the film is a slide show of these images they are well produced of museum size and have apparently appeared in several exhibitions to me however they only demonstrate that almost any photograph can be made to appear beautiful if well presented industrial waste is still industrial waste the relationship if any between the photographs and the films spoken message remains uncleari dont negmean to imply that there arent negreal and sometimes desperate problems when countries rush to industrialize manufactured landscapes however offers only strange and bitter hopelessness its like a twohour lecture by noam chomsky maybe it has some value as a demonstration of whats wrong with the american and canadian left,1
first off i would like to point out that the reason why i gave this movie  star out of  is because there is no negoption to give it no negstars it really is that bad i was never negeager to see this film after i saw the ads for it i ended up seeing it only by chance because some friends of mine had tickets and had one spare so i tagged along before seeing it i had a fairly good idea that it wouldnt negbe genius  the premise seemed far too silly and stupid for anything good to come out of it but at the back of my mind i was thinking but there must be something good about it for uma thurman and luke wilson do to the film not negthat i think either of them are particularly terrific but they are bignamed stars who would normally only do films that would enhance their reputations however about  minutes into the feature i realized that the movie was probably worse than i had at first anticipated i was shocked at how terrible the script was it really gave the actors nothing negto work with so much so that they really looked like they didnt negknow what they were doing especially luke wilson the story was completely predictable  if youve seen the ad then youve pretty much seen the movie and there was nothing negoriginal about it  it pretty much borrows from every superhero story that has ever been which would be acceptable had the film been set up as a satire of that genre but alas it wasnt the direction seemed to be of realism i got the feeling that the director wanted the film to feel completely realistic and not negsatire at all and yet there were some moments in the film that were so unbelievably unrealistic that it would have worked if it were a satire at one moment in the movie two of the characters seem to die and one of the surviving characters has a line like oh well shes deadtime to move on and he says it in such a droll voice that it completely didnt negmake any sense i found myself checking my watch after about  minutes to see how much longer i would have to sit through it and then it struck mei began to think i wonder if the studio have made this picture as a test to see if they can make the worst possible movie ever made and still pull a large audience i couldnt negthink of any other reason why this film would be made for movies to be made these days the script goes to a massive screening process and very very few scripts actually make it to the production stagei cant negcomprehend how this one got past the first draft stage by the end and exceedingly dumbfoundingly stupid climax i was laughing heartily  just not negat what the filmmakers wanted me to laugh at but instead at how ridiculous and stupid the movie was thank god i didnt neghave to pay money to see itbecause that would have really annoyed me oh and could i just add that of the two wilson brothers i have always preferred luke because i think he is a better more versatile actorbut if he wants to step even further into owens shadow then this is exactly the way to do iti doubt that he will get many more job offers after this crappy waste of  hours and remember it only got a generous  because i couldnt negselect,0

i used to watch pufnstuf every weekend when i was about  it was on right after bay city rollers i saw it come on to family channel one day and taped it for my then threeyear old daughter id forgotten all the things id loved as a child the magic flute the zoom broom witcheepoos makeupthis show is decidedly low tech the mayor is surely a precedent to mayor mccheese and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying googly eyes but kids love this stuff they would way way rather watch a guy work a sock puppet than sit in front of hightech computer animation there is mild slapstick but no negadult themes such as sex or people dying and kids accept jimmys schemes kids think it would be neat to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone their house was on fire and i loved how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky she thought witchypoo was flying overhead the music is old but you really get used to it and my daughter really loved it she used to sing different is hard different is lonely in the car my daughter watched this show at least once a day for about  months and its still one of her favouritesi see that a new pufnstuf  is in the works i really hope they try to keep the old flavour and dont negdo anything like computeranimating characters etc i think a whole new generation would love pufnstuf,0
this film was enjoyable but for the wrong reasons the coordination of the action sequences are laughable and make the film have some funny slap stick moments robert ginty and fred williamson have a memorable scene together near the end where williamson says to ginty you sure do get around buddy boy i did enjoy this film only for ginty and williamson but not negfor the storyline that must have been written on the back of a napkin in four lines and the rest adlibbed most likely a film with over  parts only has a credit list for  or so it seems odd that no negone else has a credit in the film maybe they had some insight into how the finished product would look the one thing this film does have going for it is that it is quite violent so that tripled with fred williamson and robert ginty make for a film worth seeing,0
this movie is a very realistic view of a police squad in a small german town as seen through the eyes of a woman recruit she brings her way of dealing with the law which means more than simple convictions the strong performance of the main character supported by good dialogues makes this flick very enjoyable,1
really touching story of a recruitment camp in america where young men are prepared for the vietnam war the human study always appealed to me when it comes to war movies because it translates personal subjective opinions on war opposed war action movies where action and technical data are being analyzed to the prejudice of the human factor the movie manages to put a new spin on an already ancient subject and manages to distance itself from usual war movies especially by focusing on an antihero from the viewpoint of traditional standard the movie focuses on the tragic character of bozz who smartly avoids being sucked in by the dehumanizing war machine and refuses to give up control over his destiny and fight for something he doesnt negbelieve in spends his energy in searching ways to avoid being sent overseas both for himself and comrades and ironically ends up finding his own just reason for finally going to war perfect ironythe acting is truly exceptional and the documentarystyle shooting almost makes you feel transposed into the movie also the movie will provide food for thought for those exhilarated by the action in usual war movies or wargames enthusiasts hopefully awakening some minds of a generation which luckily escaped the terror of being drafted,0
with the exception of family this new season is worse than season one i cant negimagine what they are thinking as a fan of horror can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless mayhem but this series gets worse with each outing i cant negimagine how disheartening it must be for the actors and crew to go to work each day toiling to churn out such crap story is that too much to ask for character how can we give damn about the fate of anyone in these stories if we are not negengaged who cares if they get carved up or whatever almost every episode ends with mindless blood letting going for gross out shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion or reason why we have been subjected to an hour of bloodletting even dantes effort this season had some disturbing sexist violence and wandered off to a pointless conclusion ironically the production values and performances tend to be up to speed while the content is utter crap i have great hopes for exec producers garriss valarie under the stairs but we shall see,0

halloween is one of those movies that gets you skin deep it is in my opinion the scariest movie of all time michael myers is the best boogeyman ever he was just so terrifying what makes halloween so special is that there was no negspecial effects where you can tell how computer animated it is this was on a low budget and had a one note score yet managed to scare the hell out of people  years and this movie still has the same effect as it did in its about a boy michael myers he kills his sister at the age of  and so many years later escapes the mental institution dr sam loomis is after him and will do anything to get him back since he describes michael as pure evil the blackest eyes the devils eyes michael is on a mission though to kill his other sister laurie played by a new jamie lee curtis she has to babysit on halloween while her friends are out partying and of course we know the rules they get it but laurie may stand a chance since shes the virgin d halloween pays many homages to psycho we have another character named sam loomis and jamie lee curis the daughter of janet leigh halloween is an absolute terrific movie that breaks boundaries and makes you lock the doors bolt your windows and turn off the lights theyre gonna get you theyre gonna get you halloween the ultimate horror film,0

i looked forward to watching this film and then realised that any hope of a coherent dialogue between the actors was swamped by the unnecessary swearing now i am not nega prude in any way but to shout obscenities at each other does not nega good film make ewan bremner is arguably one of the worst actors in the world at this time witness his performance in the god awful life of stuff  his cockney accent is almost as bad as his edinburgh accent avoid how many more of these films kiss kiss bang bang beautiful creatures do we have to suffer before the film makers realise that the fword the c word etc does not negreplace proper dialogue,0
dolph lundgren stars as a former copboxer who searches bostons kinky scene to find out who killed his brotherwho was well thought of in the community however along the way he learns how his brother enjoyed kinky sex and that a serial killer is to blame dolph lundgren is very good in this movie in fact on the basis of his performance here one would forget lundgrens rise to fame involved action roles that said the material gives lundgren nothing negto work with in fact lundgren is completely left out to dry in a dreary thriller which is both predictable and incomprehensible costar danielle brett is also good in fact the film works best when it centers around the chemistry of lundgren and brett indeed had the film taken the time to explore their relationship the film wouldve been fairly decent however the movie is lackluster the action is nonexistent the plot not neggiven enough exploration too much boring bs around lundgrens investigation of his brothers employer and the film is needlessly gory and ridiculous once again lundgren is actually really good as is newcomer danielle brett but the film just lumbers from one sequence to the next which makes this movie particularly disappointing if anything else though it shows how underrated lundgren is as an actor out of poor,1

i get the feeling that the producers of this mess were out to make the most painful ridiculous western ever made painful is the best word i can think of to describe iton the plus side you have nice color photography and beautiful and wellspoken rhonda fleming my sympathy goes to jacques aubuchon who played the cripple who acted well enough in an annoying role written so atrociously that no negactor could give an enjoyable performance the production values were quite good which only served to highlight the terrible story and screenplaythings i hated stewart granger looked so little like a western figure what with his british accent neat tailored outfit and silly immaculate alwayswhite kerchief tied around his neck it got tiresome the way the townspeople and his son were constantly haranguing and insulting granger and he never negspoke up or replied back i know we are supposed to suspend disbelief and appreciate westerns as symbolic morality plays but this one broke the spell with it laughably unrealistic and predictable scenes the worst being at the end where granger miraculously speedily and singlehandedly plants dynamite around a canyon pass that the bad guys cattle will pass through and then granger plants himself in the perfect spot so he can shoot the dynamite from a very far distance to create rock slides to bury and spook the cattle and bad guys seemingly destroying them all save the two main bad guys next worst is everything about the plot which is loaded with soap opera scenes nothing negin the movie seemed believable i couldnt negbelieve what all the conflict was about the bad guy was driving his herd through to market and wanted the cows to chew some grass along the way i dont negsee why something couldnt neghave been worked out you need a land ownership dispute for that dont negbother to see it,1

first let me be honest i did not negwatch all this movie i watched the first five minutes and when i realized that i had nearly fallen to sleep i decided that i may as well fast forward and see if it got any more interesting later on it didnt this film is just a collection of lame attempts to make a story which is already uninteresting and badly told into something that it would never negbecome a decent horror movie because i feel it is important to say that even a movie with poor special effects can still be good if it is well made this film isnt negand will only put you into a deep sleep if you attempt to watch it lastly i feel it is important to say that i think this movie is in the publicdomain so if you feel that you must absolutely watch it than a littlesearch on the internet will surely show you a place where you wont negneed to pay to watch this pile of cinematographic dung,1
for all the homicide junkies out there this movie was great every single character that ever was on the show made an appearance in the movie it helped to resolve some but not negall issues from the series unfortunately unless you actually did watch the series most of the enjoyment would be lost as the movie made heavy references to every season of the shows existence this probably would have been appropriate as a series finale as opposed to being a separate movie but we gotta take what we can get i hope they make more movies and continue to feature homicide characters on law and order,1
this night listener is better than people are generally saying it has weaknesses and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis no negdoubt but i think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this the whole thing feels like one of those fireside this happened to a friend of a friend of mine ghost stories one big complaint about the movie is the pacing but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility and real life just sort of plods alongno so there are no negflashy endings or earthshattering revelations no showdown scenes thank heaven you have to get into the zone when watching this movie forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a conventionallygood movie williams isnt negterrific but he easily meets the needs of the story plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic no negone as he is the everyman the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story toni collettes performance should be nominated for an oscar even if she maybe shouldnt negwin it give it a shot for quality and content alone the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days,0
beautiful film pure cassavetes style gena rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress dealing with success aging lonelinessand alcoholism she tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts embodied by the death spectre of a young girl acceptance of oneself of human condition though its overall difficulties is the real purpose of the film the parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling its like if the stage became a way out for the heroin if all american movies could only be that topquality dealing with human relations on an adult level not negtrying to infantilize and standardize feelings one of the best dramas ever,0
i just saw this episode this evening on a recentlyadded presentation by one of our local independent channels which now presents two episodes each weekdayas the gentleman opined in the other previous comment here i agree this may not neghave been one of the best programs of the series but i find it entertaining nonethelessmy father was a friend of one of the principals in my hometown cincinnati for whom young rod serling had worked in the media there  and i remember dad telling how talented and creative he was remembered there overall twilight zone is certainly one of the true classics in television and given its production during the height of the cold war period provides not negonly a view of this era in the country but also today a nostalgic picture of production techniques creative viewpoints and the actors of this era several decades ago minor spoilerthis particular story depicts as did other presentations in this series and elsewhere a story where the locale is meant to provide a surprise ending sometimes the characters are on earth from elsewhere while the story at first implies at least one is an earthling these usually contained the message as here of a situation prompted by the doomsday buttons having finally been pressed by the super powers during this cold war periodviewed today stories like this one provide a nostalgic look at this worldly viewpoint  decades ago and still provide some foodforthought  as did this episodewhile the dialog may not neghave stretched the considerable talents of the leads it still presents a simple important message and a worthwhile some minutes of entertainment and interest,0
truly awful film made by cinematographerturneddirector ted tetzlaff decent enough looking film but for a timebomb movie totally devoid of any tension whatsoever ford as someone put it here sleepwalks though this one with his characteristic smirk there are some details thrown around canadian exarmy or raf defused bombs in the war his wife is leaving him but none negof these back stories add up to much the bomber himself is a complete mystery why is he trying to blow up this shipment of mines for that matter what time period are we talking about here wwii or postwar i assumed the latter which makes bombers motive even more salient generally though just a horrible film there are plenty of good timebomb flicks to skip this one watch any episode of danger uxb for a more exciting time at about the same running time,0
my grandmother took me and my sister out to see this movie when it came out in theaters back in  and so we happily bought the tickets the popcorn and soda and walked right in to the theater and sat down to watch the movie when it was over the audience didnt negapplauded strongly i remember that i heard a few people say that they didnt neglike it at all i didnt neglike it i thought that it was rather stupid and not negworth seeing eddie murphy was hysterical in this but apart from him the whole movie was bad i rarely laughed at the parts in this i also remembered that the other people in the theater almost hardly negeven laughed and what i really thought was bad was making the animals talk because talking animals only exist in cartoons in live action movies they are totally a mutt i said that apart from eddie murphys hysterical twist he brings in this movie is not negworth watching it is rather stupidi have seen eddie murphy in several of movies and i thought that he was funny in those i have just said that he was the only funny part of this movie i also have not negseen eddie murphy in the really great movie the adventures of pluto nash this movie is not nega movie that i would really recommend that you see because apart from eddie murphy you probably are not neggoing to like this especially because of a lot the the talking animals in it ill give this movie a rating of  stars out of a possible  stars,1
once upon a time there were different types of movies these different movies coexisted even though each one had something different to offerthis seems obvious at first but i thought id point it out during this review because it seems a few people may have forgotten this is just a fun movie for pavarotti fans thats all it is it doesnt negclaim to be anything else or anything grander people who deride it as something that fell short of a promise arent negseeing the whole picture literally after all hollywood makes movies all the time that are shameless vehicles for people bodyguard or the preachers wife wwhitney houston are  examples that spring to mindfirst id like to address the movie as a vehicle for pavarotti there are worse things in this world and worse movies the singing is fabulous and the selection of arias is fun the movie starts with schuberts ave maria and then leoncavallos matinatta pav sings arias from la gioconda manon lescaut and turandot but also sings popular music such as i left my heart in san francisco and the song that was nominated for an oscar  golden globe if we were in love wmusic by john williams  lyrics by alan  marilyn bergman all  previous oscar winnersthe story isnt negthat bad it was built for pavarotti so of course its not neggoing to be something thats profound or universally applicable to the average movie viewer its a story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night at the opera years ago when asked to sing again at the same place the met in nyc he loses his voice from fear doctor pamela or pahmaylah in italian played by kathryn harrold gives him a shot to cure his psychosomatic reaction he offers her the chance to have a fling with him and she reluctantly acceptsthey embark on an affair she knowing hes married  promising not negto fall in love with him and him thinking she will be just another woman despite all that they fall in love thus the song if we were in love and with her help he overcomes his fear  goes back to the met where he triumphs i wont negtell how it ends but its fairly predictable which isnt negalways a bad thing the performances in this arent negthat bad pavarotti who plays giorgio fini isnt negan actor so if youre expecting a spencer tracy or tom hanks performance you are deluded not negpavarotti he knows hes not nega thespian what he is is cute charming  charismatic he is having fun himself and if you can just let yourself have fun too its not negso bad one funny line is when he tells pamela harrold that shes a thirsty plant fini can water you and of course she says i dont negwant to be watered on by fini kathryn harrold is very sweet and does a nice job as a semiuptight woman who learns from this extravagant man to live a little one of my favorite lines in the movie is life never neghas to be life size and theres eddie albert who does his usual good job as finis manager there are several themselves cameos by real conductors singers etc and it is filmed on location at the metropolitan opera at lincoln center if you like opera if you like pavarotti or if you can just let yourself go  enjoy a little fling just like he proposes in the movie then you can enjoy this movie for what it is i know i do every time,1

i think this movie is absolutely beautiful and im not negreferring only to the breathtaking scenery its about two unhappy english housewives who decide to rent an italian castle to take a break from their not negso happy home lives in the end four women total rent the place together all with different personalities and different reasons for being there in this magically beautiful place they all find the peace theyre longing for and interestingly that peace comes from inward reflections and resolutions more so than without i also find it wonderful because of the relationships that are developed out kindness and understanding the acting is a joy to watch in itself i especially love the characters of lottie josie lawrence and lady caroline polly walker,0
this film is terrible i was really looking forward to it as i thought lantana was greatthe following review may contain spoilersfirst the good things it looks great some of the performances are ok the bad things are everything else about it the story as you possibly know is about some blokes who go fishing and discover a body with the twist that they find it on friday but continue fishing and finally report it on sunday when they get back into mobile cell phone range however the film takes its time boy does it take its time getting to this central eventof the ensemble of characters about a dozen not negone seems to like another one which is i suppose consistent because they are all unlikable i was extremely frustrated by the failure to adequately explain how the characters are related and it was not neguntil near the end of the movie that i could vaguely construct the family tree its hard to think of a film us unrelentingly grim which is a failure in the structure of the story as the characters lives seem just as bad before the fishing trip as after once youve set the bar so high its hard to upit short of everyone committing suicidethere are silly lapses in logic the killer dumps the body in the lake and then it somehow drifts miles upstream into the mountains the fishermen walk out sunday morning but for some reason byrne gets home late at night after his wife has gone to bed then first thing the next morning the cops bang on the door to get him to come down to the station um they havent negheard of the telephone down at the station the media know the whole story less than  hours after they reported the bodytotally missing from the story is the debate the blokes surely had after they find the body this is a mystery  everyone asks them how could you do that and the audience is asking the same question the debate about what to do with the body is the key scene in deliverance i know exactly what id do in their situation someone needs to walk out to the car drive to mobile range call the cops wait and them guide them back to the location if the others wait at camp and fish who caresa lot of all this just seems false the only thing that rung true was that as the girl was black the local aboriginals seized on the fishermens actions as racist  wouldnt neghave done it if it was a white girl throughout there is a curious indifference to who might have killed the girl i think the subject is mentioned once and there is no negmystery as the audience sees the killer in the opening sceneso im sitting there simultaneously bored and confused when theres a twist  not negin the plot but the theme suddenly it becomes about the quiet dignity of the bereaved aboriginals leading to a ludicrous ending with some incoherent stuff about blackwhite reconciliation huhthis is australian film at its finest according to the age,0
the reasons to watch this knock off err tribute to a great movie called seen  its on while your channel surfing and theres nothing negelse on  someone pays you to watch itdo yourself a favor and pop in the dvd for seen rent it download it on itunes or put it in your netflix cue and skip the flock entirely the flock the same story with with a few changes furthermore the editing just wreaks of seen and actually ends up taking you out of the story several times the worst one is probably the fly over desert helicopter shots with sounds of people people chattering over the radio except there are no negpolice helicopters flying overhead in this onebottom line i call it a blatant knock off if you wanna be nice you can call it a tribute film go ahead but either way go watch seen,0

i definitely recommend reading the book prior to watching the film this book won national book council award in  and is a very gripping read pun not negintended its not negtoo difficult to read for those out there that dont negread often so dont negbe afraid the book seems to capture the passion of the relationships more so than the movie and the movie will make more sense after reading the book having grown up in melbourne i could really relate to this book and movie very few australian female writers were around the in the s therefore very little is documented about the way of life for a women in an urban city in australia during this era or class its a precious piece of melbourne history its a shame that it is documented as some sort of s soft porn movie its far from that and as the other reviewer has mentioned please do not negread the dvd jacket it does not negrepresent what the movie is about at all those that rent the movie based on this description will only be disappointed just remember this movie was made in  so dont negexpect the hollywood over dramatization that they seem to incorporate these days this is what i like about it its also great seeing noni hazlehurst in this role she is just fantastic as nora and its great watching her really acting for if youre close to my age you will best remember her for her stints on playschool and better homes and gardens who knew she hid this talent this movie will give you an entirely new impression of her a classic australian story,1
i would just like to state that this may be biased as i am a producer on the film however i will maintain some sense of dignitythe star of the film oscar ovies gives a stellar performance as jeff grinderlin a nebbish hypochondriac who spends more time worrying than living he brings a certain touch to his character that really allows the audience to connect with him by stating his mind often and with a sense of harsh comedy his mother played by christine haber is the constant support beam that without he would crumble upon himself his friends also lend a hand in jeffs life often making choices for him rather than letting him use his free will which often times he neglects is there anyway the writing is superb and the conversations flow like scenes from a kevin smith movie with half as much ben affleck boohoo feststhe camera work is a little shoddy at some points and the sound could also use a boost however the performances out shine the minor negdetails it is also backed by a beautiful soundtrack with local talents and an exceptional composerall in all this was a treat a rare gem among many jewels,0
